During a discussion with <a href=# id=auto-tag_bill-maher data-tag=bill-maher>Bill Maher</a>‘s&nbsp;Club Random&nbsp;podcast, the West Coast icon spoke about the dangerous “social engineering” that record labels conduct. He told the pundit that the proof can be found when you “follow the money.” Cube then <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>elaborated on his ominous claim</a>, saying that following the money will show that some owners of record labels also own prisons.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Who benefits and profits off our bickering and division?” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the outspoken figure</a> questioned. “I don’t know their names, but if you follow the money, you go high enough, you start to see… literally the same people who own the record labels own the prisons.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As the&nbsp;BIG3&nbsp;founder continued, he began to speak to the supposed dubious connection between record labels and prisons. He then noted that “it seems really kind of suspicious, if you want to say that word, that the records that come out are really geared to push people towards that prison industry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-615695582.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s not about making someone write the lyrics; it’s about being there as guardrails to make sure certain songs make it through, certain songs don’t, and certain flavors are exposed on the record. Some records are made by committee, meaning record label guys sit around, and they say, ‘This is hot, say that.’ So, you have the record label pushing these [criminal] narratives.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Recently, Cube also spoke out against the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>use of A.I in the music industry</a>. During an interview with&nbsp;the Full Send&nbsp;podcast in May 2023, the hosts asked Cube about the use of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>artificial intelligence</a>&nbsp;and a track&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>mimicking Drake and The Weeknd</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The LA native voiced his disapproval of the “demonic” practice. “I don’t wanna hear an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A.I</a>.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake</a>&nbsp;song,” the veteran said. “Yeah, I don’t wanna hear that bullsh*t. He should sue whoever made it.” He then declared that he would sue if a fan were to make an A.I. track using his likeness.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Yeah, and I’ma&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sue the muthaf**ka who made it</a>&nbsp;and the people and the platform who play it. It’s like a sample. Somebody can’t take your original voice and manipulate it without having to pay… I think A.I. is demonic [and] I think A.I. is going to get a backlash from organic people.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX56wpnnCrpmeZZGisrO1wpqlZqqVmLyzsIylmJudnKh6pL7IpqCnmZxirqTAyK%2BgrbFdZn90gJZwaHJwZ2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

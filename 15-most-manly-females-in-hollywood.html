Cultures from all over the world make a point of revering women for their dainty and feminine features. From the Asian tradition of binding women’s feet to make them appear more dainty to the Western world that has become accustomed to women getting nose jobs when the situation calls for it, it is an unspoken rule that a woman must have ultra feminine features to be considered beautiful. Yet, this isn’t always the case when it comes to Hollywood standards. While there are certainly a great number of Hollywood starlets that fit the perfect mold when it comes to the typical celebrity beauty, not all female celebrities look like <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> or <a href=#>Kate Upton</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, some of the most celebrated celebrities in Hollywood have some truly masculine features. Celebrated more for their talent than their appearance, these are the women that haven’t conformed to the status quo in Hollywood. Whether it’s refusing to alter their strong facial features, embracing their larger physical form, or just dressing in a more masculine way, there are some celebrities that aren’t exactly the dainty wallflower society demands of them. Check out our list of the 15 most manly females in Hollywood, and see how these starlets have broken out of the mold without hindering their careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-coco><strong>15. Coco</strong></h2><p>Oftentimes, when a woman has super masculine features, she tends to overcompensate by flaunting her most feminine parts. This is definitely the case for Nicole Marrow, publicly known as <a href=#>Coco</a>. The wife of rapper and actor, <a href=#>Ice-T</a>, Coco has made a name for herself beyond just being the buxom blonde on his arm on the red carpet. She’s starred in a number of television shows and movies, and even replaced <a href=#>Holly Madison</a> in the Las Vegas revue, Peepshow. However, she’s mostly known for her outrageously half-naked photos she loves to post to her social media sites. From g-string bikini shots to outright nude photos, Coco seems to try and overcompensate by using her sexuality to attract attention. Yet, a closer look at Coco’s facial features can be an eye-opening experience. From the overly harsh makeup tactics to the masculine facial features, Coco is definitely far from the feminine wallflower that can be associated with California blondes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-lady-gaga><strong>14. Lady Gaga</strong></h2><p>Lady Gaga first introduced herself to audiences with an over-the-top look that included things like the infamous meat dress and even a bejeweled wheelchair. Yet, it was her stint as her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, that really had people talking. She used this look in two of her music videos and even kept up the persona when she went to the 2011 Video Music Awards. Unlike other female starlets that only had to cut their hair to take on a male persona, Gaga went all out. From full-on sideburns to hairy armpits, she hoped to embody this male persona full force. While she did have to tape down her breasts and take on some masculine affectations, it was actually pretty scary how easily it was for her to look like a man. There was one point at the VMAs where <a href=#>Beyonce</a> revealed her pregnancy on stage, and the camera cut to Gaga’s reaction. Fans almost forgot that it was Lady Gaga underneath that male ensemble, and it just looked like some greasy-haired guy in the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-mayim-bialik><strong>13. Mayim Bialik</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a> was first introduced to audiences as a child star, and stole people’s hearts in portrayals in Beaches and Blossom. While she took some time out from the limelight to further her education (and grow up without the intense scrutiny of Hollywood), she eventually returned to acting in the hit television series, The Big Bang Theory. While critics often suggest that Hollywood is blatantly biased when it comes to actresses and their expected good looks, Bialik has definitely broken the mold. She certainly isn’t the typical Hollywood beauty, and yet seems to be celebrated nonetheless. While she’s often thought of as a favorite character in the series, her ultra masculine look hasn’t gone unnoticed. Perhaps it was her real life degree in neuroscience that helped to land her the job, or perhaps it was how easily she would fit in with a predominantly male cast. Whatever the case, fans have stuck by her side through all the criticisms and have even applauded her for not kowtowing to public convention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-kaley-cuoco><strong>12. Kaley Cuoco</strong></h2><p>Best known for her role as Penny on the hit sitcom, The Big Bang Theory, <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco</a>, is one of the highest paid actresses on television. She is thought of as a favorite among fans of the show, and not just because she started off as the only female mainstay character. Yet, while she was coined as the ultra hot girl that lived across the hall, there were those that wondered exactly how she landed that role. Cuoco is far from being considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, and many have criticized the show for choosing an actress with such manly features. Perhaps this is why so much of her early appearances in the series involved her flaunting her physique. From constant appearances in tank tops to various shots in pajama shorts, people didn’t see the need to focus on her face while she was onscreen. Yet, it’s not just her strong facial features that give off a masculine feel since her arms have always been disproportionately thick. Even during the early seasons of the show, Cuoco didn’t have the dainty and feminine look that showrunners were probably hoping for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-barbra-streisand><strong>11. &nbsp;Barbra Streisand</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Barbra Streisand</a> is one of the most respected and celebrated female stars in Hollywood. As one of only 12 celebrities that can boast being an EGOT, she has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony award. In many cases she has won multiple awards, including two Oscars. Perhaps her most memorable performance was for the 1983 film, Yentl, where she not only wrote, produced, and directed in, but she also starred as the main character. Playing a woman impersonating a man, this was a role that would have been challenging for any actress. Yet, Streisand pulled it off without a hitch. However, it was definitely helped by the fact that she need only don a short haircut to fool audiences into thinking that she was a man. While <a href=#>Twiggy</a> made a pixie haircut look cute and feminine, Barbra Streisand’s strong facial features combined with her short haircut created the look of just a typical young man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-diane-keaton><strong>10. &nbsp;Diane Keaton</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Diane Keaton</a> is one of the few leading ladies in Hollywood that hasn’t been pushed out to pasture just because she’s reached a particular age. Ever since her film debut in the 1970s, she has been a consistently working actress that continues to receive acclaim. From her portrayal in The Godfather to her onscreen chemistry with <a href=#>Jack Nicholson</a> in Something’s Gotta Give, Keaton has always found a way to win over the audience with her acting skills and onscreen personality. Yet, her offscreen look has always been somewhat of an amusement since she seems to like to forego the couture gown status quo on the red carpet. Rather than showing off the trim physique she’s managed to hold onto regardless of her age, Keaton often dons men’s attire on the red carpet. Perhaps she is still trying to channel her character from the critically-acclaimed film, Annie Hall, or perhaps she just enjoys wearing a men’s suit. Regardless, she definitely can’t be considered ultra feminine if she’s always seen wearing a suit and tie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-glenn-close><strong>9. &nbsp;Glenn Close</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Glenn Close</a> is an actress that has received numerous awards and accolades throughout her long career, including numerous Tony and Emmy Awards. As a multitalented actress, she has been a favorite for casting directors in search of a truly skilled performer. However, her looks aren’t necessarily categorized as ultra feminine. While she has been cast as the leading lady in numerous films, at times fans found it difficult to see how she could be such a sought-after woman by some of Hollywood’s hottest leading men. From <a href=#>Michael Douglas</a> cheating on his wife to be with her in Fatal Attraction to playing the girlfriend of <a href=#>Robert Redford</a> in The Natural, Glenn Close has scored some pretty amazing leading roles regardless of her manly features. Yet, it’s not just audiences that feel this about Close since even filmmakers felt that she was the perfect actress to play the role of a man. In 2011, Close starred in the film, Albert Nobbs, where she portrayed a 19th-century woman posing as a man to land a job as a butler. Needless to say, she was able to fool audiences with ease just by donning a short hairstyle and a tailored suit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-sarah-jessica-parker><strong>8. &nbsp;Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> is best known for her role as Carrie Bradshow on the hit HBO series, Sex and the City (which was later adapted into a hugely successful film series), but she has proven that she is far more than just an actress. She took a leading role during the height of the popularity of the HBO series, and even put her producing and directing skills to work. Parker has also solidified herself as a fashion icon offscreen, so perhaps she picked up a few things while starring in a series that was so entrenched in fashion. Whether she developed a relationship with some of the designers that worked closely with the show or she just had a natural inclination towards fashion, Parker is truly respected by her peers in the fashion industry. Yet, while she’s known for setting trends and looking great on the red carpet, her strong facial features aren’t exactly thought of as feminine. While her look was a little softened in her younger years, time hasn’t been very friendly to our favorite Sex and the City girl. Nowadays, her strong facial features look harder than ever, and her appearance is definitely leaning towards masculine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-brigitte-nielson><strong>7. &nbsp;Brigitte Nielson</strong></h2><p>Early on in her career, <a href=#>Brigitte Nielson</a> started off as a very successful supermodel and even landed herself a few acting roles alongside some of Hollywood’s top male actors. Her signature short, blonde hair created a look that went well with her tall and sleek physique. Yet, she wasn’t able to hold onto her supermodel form as she aged, and she also had trouble holding the attention of A-list actors. After her marriage to <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a> came to an end, there weren’t many hot male celebrities actively seeking out Nielson to be their plus-one (that is, unless you count <a href=#>Flavor Flav</a> as an A-list celebrity). As she aged, Nielson went the route of bodybuilding rather than simply staying tone, and the result has been the look of an aged wrestler. From the manly biceps to the defined forearms, she definitely no longer looks like a former supermodel. Nielson spent some time letting herself go, and struggled with alcoholism that played out in front of the cameras on Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. Spending all that time away from the gym didn’t bode well for her physique, and it didn’t help to stray from her ultra masculine look. Perhaps she should think about foregoing her short hairstyle, and try and opt for something a bit more feminine to offset some of her other masculine features.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><h2 id=6-tilda-swinton><strong>6. &nbsp;Tilda Swinton</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Tilda Swinton</a> is an actress that has a career filled with a great mix of different types of films. From independent films to mainstream blockbuster hits, Swinton has a well-rounded career that has given her the respect she deserves as a skilled actress. One of her more memorable roles was starring alongside <a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a> in the 2005 film, Constantine. Swinton played the role of the androgynous half-breed angel, Gabriel, which is pretty fitting to her own persona. While Swinton isn’t exactly a hermaphrodite, she does seem to have both male and female characteristics. Needless to say, she expertly played the role, and was more than convincing as Gabriel. Audiences have yet to see Swinton with a truly feminine look offscreen, and she seems to gravitate towards roles that stray from the typical role offered to Hollywood starlets. While her porcelain skin and fit physique have a certain appeal, her boyish hairstyle and hard features make for a more masculine look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-grace-jones><strong>5. &nbsp;Grace Jones</strong></h2><p>There are few celebrities that can boast being as accomplished as <a href=#>Grace Jones</a>, especially since she started her career at such a young age. At just 13-years-old, Jones began working for some of the hottest designers in the world, including Yves St. Laurent. While other 13-year-olds were focused on their 8th grade dance, Jones was gracing the cover of Vogue magazine. While she continued her modeling career, she also began delving into some of her other interests. She became an accomplished singer/songwriter, producer, and even dabbled in acting. While Jones hasn’t exactly become a celebrity sensation in the U.S., she is practically the UK’s equivalent of <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> due to her over-the-top costumes and stage performances. Although everyone can agree that Jones has been able to maintain her looks (despite being almost 70-years-old), it’s hard to deny the masculinity of her facial features. This combined with her practically bald head, and it’s almost impossible to decipher whether or not she is in fact a woman. It’s a good thing she likes to pack on the makeup, otherwise there might be some confusion by the general public when she’s caught out and about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-khloe-kardashian><strong>4. &nbsp;Khloe Kardashian</strong></h2><p>When it comes to the Kardashian sisters, many people are surprised to know that <a href=#>Khloe</a> is the youngest. Perhaps this is because their mother, <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a>, definitely doesn’t treat her like she’s her little baby. In fact, the entire series of Keeping Up with the Kardashians has proven that she has an obvious favorite, and it’s definitely <a href=#>Kim</a>. On top of the fact that she isn’t babied by Kris, Khloe has a completely different look than any of the rest of the Kardashian clan. While <a href=#>Kourtney</a> and Kim truly have a likeness, Khloe’s look is so far off base that it’s caused many to speculate whether or not she is an offspring of one of Kris Jenner’s affairs. Some have even said that Khloe resembles <a href=#>O.J. Simpson</a>, and it’s hard to deny how much Khloe looks like O.J.’s biological daughter, Sydney Simpson. Regardless of whether or not you believe that Khloe is a true Kardashian, the underlying issue is on how masculine her facial features are. While Kim and Kourtney have a chiseled jawline and natural contouring in the cheekbones, Khloe has more of a squared jawline and a much broader nose. This combined with her taller stature and larger size doesn’t help to add any femininity points her way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-teyana-taylor><strong>3. &nbsp;Teyana Taylor</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Teyana Taylor</a> is a music artist that is finally starting to make a name for herself. Although she started her career at an early age, true fame has always been elusive. Taylor had a brief stint at stardom during her appearance on My Super Sweet 16, but her time in the limelight was fleeting. She also worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry, but even her time working alongside <a href=#>Pharrell Williams</a> and <a href=#>Usher</a> didn’t help her to become a true breakout artist. It wasn’t until she signed with <a href=#>Kanye West</a> that she started to become noticed as a solo artist to be reckoned with. There are those who have compared her look to <a href=#>Rihanna</a> and although there are a few similarities, there are some blatant differences in her facial features. She seems to be aware of her overly masculine features because she tends to overcompensate with provocative clothing and barely-there ensembles. Her most recent display was in her Flashdance-inspired routine in the “Fade” video with Kanye West, where she wore a pair of panties while strutting her stuff. That’s one surefire way to distract from her manly facial features!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><h2 id=2-uma-thurman><strong>2. &nbsp;Uma Thurman</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Uma Thurman</a> has always been considered an odd beauty, but that only seemed to make her even more attractive during her younger years. Yet, time has since rolled on, and all of the little quirks that made her face that much more interesting have started to harden some of her more masculine features. While it may seem like Pulp Fiction was just the other day, it was actually released in 1994 and she no longer looks like the ultra beautiful wife of Marsellus Wallace. Even the Kill Bill film series concluded in 2004, and the time that has gone on after this memorable film moment in her career has not treated Thurman kindly. Film roles have been hard to come by for Thurman, and this will probably continue to be difficult for the aging actress since a number of photos showed that she’s been dabbling in some plastic surgery attempts. Perhaps she is trying to stave off the aging process or perhaps she’s trying to soften some of the hard edges of her masculine features, but whatever the case, it hasn’t worked. Nowadays, she seems to want to hide behind layers of clothing when out and about, and she is starting to look even farther from her former self.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-wendy-williams><strong>1. &nbsp;Wendy Williams</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Wendy Williams</a> started off her career in radio, and created a name for herself as the loud-mouthed woman over the airwaves. Yet, she was thrust into the limelight when she received her own talk show, The Wendy Williams Show. Once she was in front of the camera, critics began calling her out more for what she looked like rather than what she said. Some of the harshest criticisms revolved around some people declaring that she is in actuality a man that has transitioned into a woman. In an interview with ABC News, Williams addressed these comments by saying, “I get it. I’ve got a strong face, a strong body, I’m 5’11. I wear wigs.” She has always stayed on top of the argument by addressing it, rather than hoping it would just go away. She’s mentioned how hurtful those comments are on her talk show, and has even shed a few tears on how difficult her childhood was in regards to bullying. During her ABC News interview, she stated, “There’s no worse way to insult a woman than by saying she looks like a man, but once a woman gets over that, there is no stronger woman.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources:</strong><a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, <a href=#>CNN</a>, <a href=#>Page Six</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ivLTAjKaYp6SpYrOmucClnKxlmaN6qbvLpbCwp5%2BZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

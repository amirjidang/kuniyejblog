Instead, it was Rimes' chest that stole the show, as she decided to leave the store braless in a semi-sheer gray dress.</p><p>When Rimes first arrived at the store, she was wearing a mini-skirt and cardigan. "It was hot and I bought a dress and didn't want to put my other clothes back on. I was lazy," she explained via <a href=#>Twitter</a>. "Sue me."</p><p>When the 29-year-old singer was teased on Twitter for revealing too much, she <a href=#>shot back</a>: "You are telling me you've never worn something out of a store that you just bought? You are just jealous and want to borrow my dress."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Perhaps Rimes was eager to show off her body: in January, a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that the country singer got a boob job from the same plastic surgeon Cibrian's ex-wife <strong>Brandi</strong> <strong>Glanville</strong> once used.</p><p>"She's always, always been insecure about her size. She was a small A-cup," the insider said. "She often talked about wanting to get implants. She'd say, 'I just want a little bit so they’re proportionate to my body.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6W2pHnLnpinpl2ntq6x0maeqJ2jYq%2BzrcueqqxlmaN6rq3LopmuZWJlfnJ%2BlmpoaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

While undoubtedly, some of these romantic rumors have turned out to be untrue, just the mere suggestion of a relationship with one of the most prominent singers in the world is enough to draw interest.</p><p>For example, in 2012, Taylor Swift was romantically linked with singer and songwriter Martin Johnson.

Although <strong>Tisdale has been married to Christopher French </strong>since 2014, the star had been in a romantic relationship with <strong>musician, songwriter, and record producer Martin Johnson</strong>. Reports of <strong>Tisdale dating the former Boys Like Girls front-man</strong> began in early January 2012. As published by The Huffington Post, Tisdale and Johnson were spotted by the press and photographers leaving LAX in Los Angeles. According to the publication, the couple was returning to LA after spending a weekend together in New York City, wherein they celebrated New Year's Eve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ashley-tisdale-looking-confident.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to US Weekly, <strong>Ashley Tisdale and Martin Johnson first met </strong>after the former starred in the "Love Drunk" music video for Johnson's punk rock band.

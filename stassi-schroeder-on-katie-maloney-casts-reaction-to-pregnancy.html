Katie was one of the first people that I told I was pregnant and she knew that I was trying [to conceive] so she was waiting for it,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>&nbsp;</i>alum, 34, <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>on Monday, March 13</a>, while promoting her upcoming <a href=#><i>Mommy Dearest </i></a>Tour. “We <a href=#>used to do this workout</a> every Monday for, like, a year and a half. We were doing [EMS training] at my house every Monday … and I obviously can’t do that when I’m pregnant and I was scared to do it even when I was trying.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “So it was one of those things where I’m like, ‘Katie, we can’t work out anymore. It happened, I’m pregnant.’ But, yeah, Katie knew [and <a href=#><strong>Tom] Schwartz</strong> </a>knew, [because my husband], <a href=#><strong>Beau [Clark]</strong></a>, is really close to Schwartz. I mean, so am I.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pregnant-Stassi-Schroeder-Says-Of-Course-Katie-Maloney-Was-1-of-the-1st-People-She-Told-About-Baby-No.-2.jpg><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Off With My Head&nbsp;</i>author, who <a href=#>gave birth to daughter Hartford in January 2021</a>, and Clark, 42, announced earlier this month that <a href=#>they are expecting baby No. 2</a>. The couple, <a href=#>who tied the knot in 2020</a>, <a href=#>later revealed they’re having a son</a>. After sharing the happy news, <a href=#>several of the duo’s former<i>&nbsp;</i>costars reached out</a> with well-wishes.</p><p class=p1>“Honestly, <a href=#>most people from<i>&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;</i>contacted me</a> — texted me or messaged me in some way — when they found out I was pregnant,” Schroeder told <i>Us</i>. “I mean, just because we’ve all had our issues, and even though I’m off the show, it’s like we continue to still [stay in touch], because we all have podcasts, so <a href=#>we’re always talking about something</a>. … So even though I’m out of it, it’s like the drama continues, but despite that, I think because we’ve gone through so much together for so long — for over 10 years now — we come back together to support each other when it’s important.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “We’re all really good at putting our differences aside when there’s something important, like a baby being born. It’s like, who cares if you’re fighting? You congratulate each other on that, you know?”</p><p class=p1>While most of the Bravo stars learned of the news via Schroeder’s social media announcement, Maloney, 36, got the scoop first because of <a href=#>her role as Hartford’s godparent</a>.</p><p class=p1>“She used to see [Hartford] every Monday,” the Louisiana native shared on Monday. “It’s so weird when you’re used to seeing somebody every single Monday, like, [you have a] routine and then you get pregnant and it’s like, ‘Wait, I miss you.’ But, <a href=#>she’s the best and she loves Hartford</a>.”</p><p class=p1>While Schroeder and Maloney had to <a href=#>put their intense weekly workout on pause</a> amid the<a href=#>&nbsp;<i>Amazing Race&nbsp;</i></a>alum’s pregnancy, the former Bravo star isn’t letting her growing family get in the way of her live podcast tour.</p><p class=p1>“I was actually putting off trying to get pregnant because I wanted to go on tour. I was like, ‘OK, 2022 spring, we’re gonna finally have our wedding [and] spring 2023, let’s plan for the tour.’ And then I thought to myself, ‘Well, I really wanna get pregnant, but I can’t go on tour and not have Aperol spritzes,’” Schroeder told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “[But] then I had this moment where I realized that being pregnant [and] having another kid is what I want more than anything in the world, more than going on tour.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>She explained: “And so I was like, ‘Actually, this is gonna be really fun,’ because I feel like I’ll be way more focused, I’ll be way more motivated and there’s something that, like, happens when I get pregnant where I just feel like I want to do more, more, more, more. So, I just feel like this is gonna be a completely different experience than what it was like the first time I went on tour.”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Sarah Jones</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasrJGowKp50pyfq6eVmbKzec6nZKSZpJ6ybrnApaannalisKK%2F06xkq52RmMGqu81mq6hloKeyqLrAp5qyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

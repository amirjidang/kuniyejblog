When <a href=#>following the 90210's cast's careers</a>, Ian hasn't acted quite as much as some of his co-stars, but it seems like his family life has kept him busy. Ian has been married twice and is raising two elementary school-aged daughters.</p><p>Unlike fellow cast members like <a href=#>Shannen Doherty who left 90210 early</a> or <a href=#>Jason Priestley who opened up about the series</a>, Ian Ziering isn't talked about as much. However, his romantic life has been dramatic. Here's whether Ian Ziering paid a lot for his first divorce.</p><h2 id=did-ian-ziering-spend-a-lot-of-money-on-his-divorce-from-nikki-ziering>Did Ian Ziering Spend A Lot Of Money On His Divorce From Nikki Ziering?</h2><p>Ian Ziering and Nikki Ziering were <strong>married from 1997 to 2002</strong>.

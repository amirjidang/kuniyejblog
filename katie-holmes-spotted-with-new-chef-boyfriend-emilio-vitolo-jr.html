The Dawson’s Creek alum wore a blue surgical face mask as did the 33-year-old chef.</p><p>Vitolo Jr. is the chef at the popular Italian eatery Emilio's Ballato in Manhattan, which is owned by his father Emilio Vitolo Sr. In a review of the restaurant, New York Magazine said the spot has a 'clubby' atmosphere since Emilio Sr. decides which customers are seated as he holds court at his regular table at the front of the restaurant. Customers have included former <a href=#>President Barack Obama</a> and Hollywood stars <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a> and Bradley Cooper.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Katie Holmes Dishes About Dawson's Creek: Is A Reunion Happening?</a></span></p><p>The couple was first linked on September 1 when they were seen at the Mediterranean restaurant Antique Garage in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood.

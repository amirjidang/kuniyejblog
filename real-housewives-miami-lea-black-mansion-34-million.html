This time, it's not for a show. It's more of a 'showcase.' She has just&nbsp;listed her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">enormous mansion for sale</a> for a whopping $34 million, and the more that's discovered about this property, the more intriguing it becomes. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ </a>reports this huge price tag is a small price to pay for the fancy surroundings and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very famous neighbor</a>s that surround the star's former home. Those with the budget will certainly not want to miss out on the chance to live in the lap of luxury known as Lea Black's life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Fieri Buys A Florida Mansion Following Big New Network Deal</a></span></p><p>There are mansions, and there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mega-mansions</a>, and Lea Black definitely has the latter. Not much has been heard of the reality TV star in recent months, and now it has become clear to fans that it's because she had no real reason to ever leave her luxurious home. Nestled in the very highly esteemed area of Star Island, Miami, Lea's mansion is every bit as elaborate as the neighborhood's name suggests.</p><p>Lea and her husband, defense attorney Roy Black, have been quietly living their best lives in one of the most truly admired neighborhoods that most people could only ever dream of. Their home can now be yours, if $34 million is within budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ,</a> this 7 bedroom, 7 bathroom mansion is centralized in an area that is "home to&nbsp;Alex Rodriguez, Diddy, Shaquille O'Neal, Naomi Campbell, Gloria and Emilio Estefan," and that's just to name a few. It's not every day that a walk through the neighborhood packs the same star power as a red carpet event - unless you live here.</p><p>The proud new owner of this home will be able to enjoy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a luxurious lifestyle that boasts more amenities than can be listed</a>. In fact, the Blacks spent a fortune renovating and re-renovating the home during their 11 year ownership of the property, and the modern state of the sprawling estate are certainly reflective of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home is a 10,636-square-foot extravagant mansion with oversized rooms, expensive detailing, state-of-the-art appliances, and an abundance of luxuries.

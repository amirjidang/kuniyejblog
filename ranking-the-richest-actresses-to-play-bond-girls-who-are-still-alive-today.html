This role was widely praised and has earned the actress a spot on this grand list.

Bond charmed his way into both these ladies' hearts, but Gemma Arterton left her mark on the fans. Gemma has accumulated this net worth from her roles in Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. Unfortunately, her time as Bond girl ended in getting smothered in crude oil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=denise-richards-12-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Denise Richards: $12 Million</span></h2><p><a href=#>Denise Richards is a very well-known American actress</a> and has appeared in many television shows as well as films.

Worse yet, it is amazing to know that Taylor went through some really tough times after he quit.</p><p>This article will reveal how<strong> Mick Taylor wound up suffering financially</strong> after leaving The Rolling Stones. The article will then look at why <strong>Taylor decided to quit The Rolling Stones</strong> at the height of their success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mick-taylor-went-broke-after-quitting-the-rolling-stones>Mick Taylor Went Broke After Quitting The Rolling Stones</h2><p>After Mick Taylor joined The Rolling Stones, he contributed to many of the band's legendary songs. Some examples of Rolling Stones songs Taylor was a part of include "Honky Tonk Women", "Wild Horses", "Angie", and "It’s Only Rock And Roll". Thanks to Taylor's status in The Rolling Stones' history, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> with the band.</p><p>Despite the heights that Taylor's career once hit, he wasn't living like a rock legend when he was interviewed by The Daily Mail in 2009. Instead, Taylor was living in a two-story house that The Daily Mail described as a "ramshackle cottage" while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>struggling to pay his bills</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-rolling-stones-mick-taylor-playing-guitar-onstage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After years of refusing interviews, Taylor agreed to talk to The Daily Mail in 2009 and show them around where he was living. As a result of Taylor agreeing to open up his home at that time, The Daily Mail was able to reveal how dire his financial situation was at that time.</p><p>In The Daily Mail's article, they described seeing a stack of unpaid bills in Taylor's home. If that wasn't bad enough, the outlet's reporter wrote that they could see letters threatening to cut off Taylor's water, electricity, and gas.</p><p>In many areas of the world, utility companies don't make threats like that unless their customer is way behind in their bills.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-mick-jagger-and-keith-richards-really-share-a-girlfriend-who-mothered-some-of-the-guitarist-s-children_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Mick Jagger And Keith Richards Really Share A Girlfriend Who Mothered Some Of The Guitarist's Children?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Anita Pallenberg dated Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and gave birth to several of the guitarist's children.</span><p>Later in the same article, The Daily Mail found another way to depict Taylor's financial troubles at that time.</p><p>The article revealed that when Taylor happens to has money, he sorts through his bills and picks some to pay. However, The Daily Mail reported that when Taylor was broke as he often was, he would call his friends and convince them to perform at a local pub to make ends meet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Daily Mail's article also reported that Taylor's home was in serious need of repairs and redecoration in 2009. When asked about the work that his house needed, Taylor told the outlet, "Yeah, I know it needs doing. I just don’t feel up for it right now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-rolling-stones-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>According to what Taylor told The Daily Mail in 2009, his money woes at that time were partly caused by a decision his former bandmates made. Taylor claimed he <strong>no longer received any Rolling Stones royalties</strong>.</p><p>"In 1982 they stopped paying me. They’d signed to a different record company and had new contracts and were advised they didn’t need to pay me anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-legendary-singer-cher-labeled-madonna-a-spoiled-brat-the-truth-about-their-feud-front-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Legendary Singer Cher Labeled Madonna A 'Spoiled Brat': The Truth About Their Feud</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Cher once called Madonna out as a "spoiled brat" which has left fans wondering if she hates the former queen of pop music.</span><p>Taylor admitted that he should have taken action to get his royalty payments back, but he just lashed out instead.</p><p>"I should have got a lawyer,’ he said. ‘But instead, I called them rude words and asked how they could just stop paying me. They all know it’s not right. In fact it is outrageous. They get all the money and I get the plaudits and praise, even from Mick."</p><p>Taylor continued, "I’ve tried to talk to Mick a couple of times, but I realize that hiring a lawyer is probably the only way they’ll take me seriously. But they figure I’m not going to do anything about it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-rolling-stones-performing-in-2012.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for Taylor, he wound up mending fences with his former band after the 2009 interview. In fact, Taylor and Bill Wyman both rejoined The Rolling Stones in 2012 for the band's 50th anniversary tour. Taylor would perform with the legendary band for an extended tour before stepping away once again.</p><p>How rich are the members of The Rolling Stones as of March 2024, according to Celebrity Net Worth?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Member:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Net Worth:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How much is Mick Jagger worth</a>?:</p></td><td><p>$500 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How much is Keith Richards worth</a>?:</p></td><td><p>$500 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How much is Charlie Watts estate worth</a>?:</p></td><td><p>$250 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How much is Ronnie Wood worth</a>?:</p></td><td><p>$200 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How much is Bill Wyman worth</a>?:</p></td><td><p>$80 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How much is Brian Jones' estate worth</a>?:</p></td><td><p>$4 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How much is Ian Stewart's estate worth</a>?:</p></td><td><p>$1 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How much is Mick Taylor worth</a>?:</p></td><td><p>$300,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor has a $300,000 fortune</a> as of March 2024.

During several interviews, Taylor has made it clear <strong>he doesn't regret quitting the band</strong> since he argues the real question is whether he regrets joining The Rolling Stones.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/inside-mick-jagger-s-troubled-relationship-with-original-rolling-stones-frontman-brian-jones-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Inside Mick Jagger's Troubled Relationship With Original Rolling Stones Frontman Brian Jones</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Rolling Stones' iconic frontman, Mick Jagger, had a complicated relationship with band founder and original leader, Brian Jones.</span><p>Still, the fascinating thing about Taylor's first tenure as a member of The Rolling Stones is why he quit. Since people are complicated, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Taylor <strong>quit The Rolling Stones for several reasons</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Taylor's aforementioned The Daily Mail interview, he told the outlet that he was angry that he didn't get enough credit. Taylor claimed that Mick Jagger told him he would get songwriting credits, but that didn't happen. "I took offense and that was a contributory factor in my departure.<strong>"</strong></p><p>In 1969, Mick Taylor joined The Rolling Stones after the band originally formed in 1962. Taylor stayed with the band until he quit in 1974 and stayed away for decades. Taylor then shocked fans by rejoining The Rolling Stones in 2012 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">touring with them until leaving again in 2014</a> . As of March 2024, there is no indication that Taylor will ever join the band again.</p><p>Taylor also explained to The Daily Mail that he didn't feel creatively fulfilled by being a member of The Rolling Stones. "I had a creative relationship with Mick, but I was also bored for a lot of the time. I wanted more and they wanted to remain the same."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rolling-stones.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, Taylor told The Daily Mail that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he quit The Rolling Stones because he'd developed an addiction issue</a>. At the time, Taylor believed that he would <strong>clean himself up</strong> if he left the band.</p><p>Sadly, Taylor revealed that his addiction to substances got worse after he left the legendary rock band. When Taylor's father was battling cancer, he was prescribed morphine, which was the substance the rock star was addicted to.</p><p>Between ease of access and the emotional turmoil Taylor was in while watching his father struggle, things got worse. "I joined the line of junkies. I was a virtual down and out." On the bright side, Taylor told The Daily Mail in 2009 that he'd been clean "for years".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopubYsGixcuoqWamlal6uLvRrZ9mmZapsrN50K6grayZo7Ruvs6lo6Kml2LAtbvNnqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The main cast already has proven chemistry together, and stepping into that environment isn't always easy. That was especially the case for stars appearing on Friends and Seinfeld - it was an intimidating experience for even some of the established actors in Hollywood. Matt LeBlanc himself revealed that several guest stars struggled to adapt during their time on the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following, we'll take a look at a particular guest star, and her involvement on both <strong><a href=#>Friends</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Seinfeld</a></strong>. As expected, Jessica Hecht had a different experience on both sitcoms, and that was especially true for her work alongside certain individuals, particularly <strong><a href=#>David Schwimmer</a></strong> and Jason Alexander. We'll reveal what her experience was like with the two, and how she felt about other stars on the iconic shows.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Hollywood Filmmakers Were Only Asking For David Schwimmer Among The Cast Of Friends, But The Actor Fought For Change And Equality</a></span></p><h2 id=jessica-hecht-believes-she-was-typecast-into-her-role-alongside-jason-alexander-on-seinfeld>Jessica Hecht Believes She Was Typecast Into Her Role Alongside Jason Alexander On Seinfeld</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52436284-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica Hecht is one of the few actresses that got to appear on both Seinfeld and Friends. She spoke alongside Today, detailing both her experiences, and it seems as though it was quite different for Hecht when comparing the two sitcoms.</p><p>For her role on Seinfeld, Hecht claims she was basically labeled as Jason Alexander's girlfriend on the show, given her status at the time in Hollywood.</p><p><a href=#>She tells Today</a>, "At that time in LA, you have to remember, most women my age were either aspiring to or had been one of George's girlfriends. It was, like, the thing you did as a young actress in her late 20s, kind of Jewish-looking actress who could be kind of funny. You would probably be called in to be one of George's girlfriends. It was like a rite of passage.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>David Schwimmer Almost Banned His Friends Offer After A Traumatic Hollywood Experience On A Different Sitcom</a></span></p><p>She didn't reveal much in regard to Jason Alexander's talent as an actor, but she did praise his attitude behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Jason (Alexander) was very sweet. These women kind of came through the factory of girlfriends, but he was incredibly lovely. Very kind.”</p><p>Ultimately, Hecht had a positive experience on the show, and the same held true for her time on Friends.</p><h2 id=jessica-hecht-loved-working-with-david-schwimmer-on-friends>Jessica Hecht Loved Working With David Schwimmer On Friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/david-schwimmer.jpg><p>On-screen, Susan and Ross didn't have the greatest relationship, especially given that Susan was largely responsible for Ross' failed marriage. However, behind the camera, it was a completely different story. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hecht praised David Schwimmer and their time together on Friends</a>. Hecht was especially complimentary towards David's approach to comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I loved working with David,” she said. “He's really smart about bits. Like, he understood how to make all the funny stuff more funny, and how to set it up.”</p><p>Hecht continued on, recalling her favorite scene on the show alongside David. “I always loved Susan's line when Ross is looking at the bookshelves and he says, ‘Wow, you got a lot of books about lesbians.’ And I think Susan says, ‘Well, they make you read a lot of books. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.’”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jason Alexander Revealed That He Doesn't Really Call The Shots In His Career</a></span></p><p>Jane Sibbett felt the same way about David Schwimmer looking back at their time together on the iconic sitcom. It was a positive environment and as it turns out, Hecht had a positive experience with her other co-stars as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-hecht-had-praise-for-her-other-co-stars-on-both-friends-and-seinfeld>Jessica Hecht Had Praise For Her Other Co-Stars On Both Friends And Seinfeld</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar50199516.jpg><p>Hecht was singing the praises of other stars on both shows. Among them, was her partner on Friends, Jane Sibbett. Hecht couldn't have asked for a better experience alongside the actress.</p><p>“She’s so beautiful to act with, and such an amazing person,” she said. “I do feel like we were successful at not over-characterizing it as anything but a loving relationship. It was just these two women who were in love, who had a balance between the two of them and were so devoted to each other. And I think that was ahead of its time.”</p><p>Hecht also praised Julia Louis-Dreyfus during her time on Seinfeld.</p><p>Ultimately, Hecht isn't surprised that both shows continue to trend, especially given all the life lessons that were shared on Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I think ‘Friends’ had such a mission to allow all the things we go through in our 20s to be visible and to pass through them awkwardly and beautifully, and in ways that no other television show has explored. And they're kind of life lessons about friendship and romance and what you struggle to realize in your 20s about yourself — that is totally timeless. If they started to air it now and just put it in contemporary dress, it would all have the same significance, except they'd have to have more cell phones.”</p><p>Hecht continues on with her career, taking on several major cameos since her time on the sitcoms. Among her notable roles includes Breaking Bad and Whatever Works.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqujnrCieceemqGsXZ2upXnCqKSppJWpsq3FjJ2gn56Vp7KvwIyer6mdop6yr6%2FErGSwoaSdequt0qilZpmcmsWiusOeqWaZnpl6pa3Voptmq5OdxKq5zJ6pZqeeYrOztcSnm6xlkaOxbr%2FEoqWfnZyZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

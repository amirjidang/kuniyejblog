The actress traded in her signature dark locks for platinum tresses with pink lowlights.</p><p>Fox, 36, debuted the fresh new ‘do at the premiere of fiancé <a href=#><strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong></a>‘s Hulu documentary, Life in Pink. To complement her <a href=#>newly dyed mane</a>, she stepped out in a blush-colored mini dress by Nensi Dojaka. The frock featured a cutout bust and a figure-hugging skirt. The Jennifer’s Body star finalized the look with strappy pink sandal heels, giving the ensemble a <a href=#>monochrome</a> finish. For her glam, Fox sported pale pink nails and a soft pink lip.</p><p>Kelly, 32, is also trying out life in pink. The rapper colored his hair a fuchsia hue and styled it slicked back. He <a href=#>coordinated with Fox</a> in a pink and blue turtleneck teamed with crisp white pants and white sneakers.</p><p>This wouldn’t be the first time the couple showcased matching outfits. On May 12, Fox wowed in a glittery pink gown as Kelly posed in a rose-adorned suit at the premiere of their movie, Good Mourning. The lovebirds also coordinated in red at a <a href=#>Met Gala</a> afterparty in September 2021.</p><p>Their romance isn’t just about fashion, however. The couple <a href=#>has weathered their fair share of scary moments</a>, which is explored in Kelly’s newly released documentary. In the film, the “Emo Girl” crooner recalled an incident where he <a href=#>contemplated suicide</a> while on the phone with Fox.</p><p>The Texas native, whose real name is Colson Baker, said that the dark moment happened in July 2020 following the death of his father, with whom he had recently reconciled.</p><p>“I wouldn’t leave my room and I started getting really, really, really dark,” the Big Time Adolescence star said. “Megan went to Bulgaria to shoot a movie and I started getting this really wild paranoia. Like, I kept getting paranoid that someone was gonna come and kill me.”</p><p>The “Papercuts” rapper went on to say that he always slept with a shotgun near his bed, but that day, he “just f–king snapped.” He called Fox whom he’d <a href=#>met in March</a> of that year while filming Midnight in the Switchgrass.</p><p>The Billboard Music Award winner said that the moment made him realize that “something is not right.” The Transformers star and Kelly’s daughter, <a href=#>Casie</a>, 12, intervened and helped him figure out that he needed to make a change.</p><p>Later that year, Kelly told Interview magazine that he was <a href=#>seeking treatment</a> for substance abuse and mental health issues.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kelly <a href=#>popped the question</a> to Fox in January. The actress hinted at their challenges, but also their strong bond in her Instagram post announcing the news. “Somehow a year and a half later, having walked through hell together, and having laughed more than I ever imagined possible, he asked me to marry him. And just as in every lifetime before this one, and as in every lifetime that will follow it, I said yes … and then we drank each other’s blood,” Fox wrote.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Fox and Kelly’s looks from the Life in Pink premiere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMnp6apl2bvLl5w56ZrqyjYq%2Btu82dnGagkZ6%2FbsPIrZ9mqJmjuG64zrCjop%2BYqcBuvMeoq6irXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

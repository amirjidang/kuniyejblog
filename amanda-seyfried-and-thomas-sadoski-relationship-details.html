Movie</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-amanda-seyfried-meet-her-husband-thomas-sadoski>How Did Amanda Seyfried Meet Her Husband Thomas Sadoski?</h2><p>It all started when they worked together on the Off-Broadway play The Way We Get By in 2015. At the time, Seyfried and Long were still dating while Sadoski was married to studio casting executive, Kimberly Hope. Though the attraction was instant, their relationship remained "strictly platonic" while they were with their respective partners. "[He] never flirted, never disrespected his wife," Seyfried recalled in 2018. "That was another reason why I thought, later on, that I could marry him." She added that they "were both in bad relationships."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, they made their relationship official. They got engaged six months later and secretly tied the knot in March 2017. At the time, <a href=#>the Mank star</a> was nine months pregnant with their daughter Nina. "I really wanted to have rings on in the hospital, you know?" Seyfried said of wanting to get married before giving birth. "And what if something goes wrong, and he's not legally my husband?" She gave birth two weeks after the wedding.</p><p>"I am more proud of Amanda than I've ever been of anybody in my entire life because she's been an incredible mom already, and we haven’t even gotten to go time yet," Sadoski said of the new mother at the time. "She's just so thoughtful, careful, loving, caring, giving, kind, generous, fun, funny. You can see it all going in there. And that level of attention that is being paid already, with all of that focus and energy and that kindness and goodness of spirit and heart, it's an amazing thing to witness."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seyfried later revealed that they didn't have any guests at their wedding. "We got married in Topanga, March last year," she said a year later. "Just the two of us. And afterwards, I was like, 'Can we just go to Cheebo?' It was awesome." In the 2017 issue of Vogue Australia, the actress couldn't help but gush about not having to wear a white wedding dress. "The fact is, that kind of stuff is less about the ceremony and more about the commitment," she explained. "I've never been excited by anything more in my life. And ready."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Amanda Seyfried Turned Down A Role In ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-amanda-seyfried-amp-husband-thomas-sadoski-39-s-relationship-like>What's Amanda Seyfried & Husband Thomas Sadoski's Relationship Like?</h2><p>In August 2020, Seyfried said that her marriage was better than ever amid the lockdown (right when every couple seemed to be breaking up). "Our family is still together," she said in an episode of the video series Molner’s Table. "I definitely think my marriage is, like, even stronger." A couple of months later, they announced the birth of their second child. "Since the birth of our daughter three years ago our commitment to the innocent children that are so brutally affected by conflict and war has been a driving force in our lives," the couple wrote in a statement. "With the birth of our son, the work of INARA and War Child has become our North Star."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source also told Us Weekly</a> that the couple enjoys being away from the limelight and spending time with their children. "The vibe [in Hudson County] just suits them all as a family, they love being around nature and away from the hustle of city life," said the insider. "Amanda loves to hike. She and Thomas [are] huge fans of the outdoors and they’ve been taking the kids out locally, plus exploring more of the East Coast." It's pretty evident on the couple's Instagram accounts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which 'Mean Girls' Star Has Landed The Most Roles Since The Movie Came Out?</a></span></p><p>Apparently, the Mamma Mia! actress also "commutes back and forth" to Los Angeles for work. Sadoski, on the other hand, is "equally adept " at "being a hands-on dad and taking care of business at home when she's busy." Now, that's how it's done. The source added that the couple puts a lot of effort into keeping their romance alive. "They try to time their schedules that way, as well as making plenty of time for date nights and trips away by themselves," they shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Real Reason Paris Hilton Ended Her Decade-Long Feud With Lindsay Lohan</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYppmema5uv8SynauhlZl6orrDZquhp52WwG6%2FwJ2mrKOZYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnDnquaoZyofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

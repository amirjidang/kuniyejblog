While he may be the face of the operation, die-hard fans tune into The Howard Stern Show for more than just the curly-haired, acerbic, entertainer from New York. They tune in to hear<a href=#> the extremely inappropriate Sal Governale</a> rip on Howard's long-time producer, Gary 'Ba Ba Booey' Dell'Abate. They tune in to hear what kind of strange new-age thing Howard's co-host Robin Quivers is going to say and what semi-ironic music Fred Norris is going to play to underscore it. Of course, not all of <a href=#>Howard's extremely well-paid staffers</a> are still with the show. While many of them have been with him for as long as his multi-decade career, others have left.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some staffers have left the show under really complicated circumstances, namely <a href=#>Howard's ex-co-host Artie Lange</a>, others have simply moved on with their careers. This seems to be the case with "so steamy" Brent Hatley. While the producer was a fixture on the radio show for a number of years, usually because of his swinger lifestyle and his know-it-all nature that ran him afoul Mamet Walker, Shuli Egar, and Ronnie Mund on numerous occasions, he has since moved on with his career. But many fans have absolutely no idea what the guy is up to nowadays. Therefore, they think his career might have been utterly destroyed after leaving the SiriusXM mega-hit. Could they be right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-brent-hatley-says-he-left-the-howard-stern-show-on-good-terms>Why Brent Hatley Says He Left The Howard Stern Show On Good Terms</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't appear as though Brent Hatley was fired from The Howard Stern Show in 2020. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As he told Stern Show Weekly</a>, a Youtube Channel that tends to try and find fault with the legendary radio host and his organization. Brent explained that he wouldn't legally be able to say that he wasn't fired if he had actually been fired. This has to do with the legality surrounding corporate exitings. In truth, Brent left The Howard Stern Show because he wanted to do something different with his career as well as move away from the cold New York weather.</p><p>"I just wanted out of New York. I wanted out of the cold. I wanted to do my own thing [creatively]. And I wanted to move back into the tropics."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stern Show Weekly also tried to get Brent to say that Howard was a bad guy and totally abandoned Brent after he left the show. While there hasn't been much contact between the two of them since Brent left (like any employee and their former business), Brent did say that Howard was extremely gracious with him when he did decide to leave.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Howard Stern Is A Great Celebrity Interviewer, According To Him</a></span></p><p>"When I left there was contact with him and he could not have been nicer. I wish I could get on here and read you the note that he sent me and the not I sent him," Brent explained. "As a human being, he's a sweet human being. I love him and [his wife] Beth as people. They are great people."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Brent Hatley Quit 'The Howard Stern Show'</a></span></p><p>Brent claims he does keep in contact with a number of his former staff mates but doesn't really want to bug Howard with anything. And anyone who knows the self-proclaimed King Of All Media would be aware that Brent is making the smart decision here and clearly knows his audience.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About All Of Howard Stern's Health Issues</a></span></p><h2 id=has-brent-hatley-39-s-career-in-broadcasting-ended>Has Brent Hatley's Career In Broadcasting Ended?</h2><p>Based on Brent's Instagram, it appears as though he's spending most of his time trying to promote his wife's Only Fans account. His Instagram is plastered with highly sensual shots of his swinger wife, Katelyn Hatley, with links to her Cameo and Only Fans account. Brent has also been spending quite a bit of time going to concerts and basically just having a great time. After all of the work he's done for The Howard Stern Show, and Bubba The Love Sponge before it, the man deserves a break... But does that mean his career is over?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Brent did start his own podcast, The Brent Hatley Show, it appears as though he's not doing much with it. In fact, Brent has been more present on other people's podcasts, including Bubba's, than his own. So, it does seem as though his broadcasting career is over for the time being. But maybe this is what he wants. After all, with his talents and credentials, he could easily get a job somewhere else. However, some fans are likely to say that he should have never left The Howard Stern Show, to begin with. Maybe they're right. But Brent is clearly onto a different stage in his life.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Howard Stern Tried To Set Up His Staffer With Kate Beckinsale's Assistant</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq52eqXqprdOlnLJlmKTEor7DZqqtnaKjerLByK1ksKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGKwor7Enqlmm5GisrB7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

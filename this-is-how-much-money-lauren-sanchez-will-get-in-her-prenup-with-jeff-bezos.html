According to new reports, should their marriage end, it appears Lauren will likely be entitled to a generous settlement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Speaking to Page Six</a>, attorney Brett Ward explained the prenup will likely give Lauren $1 million for every year married. He adds that it’s also not unlikely for her to receive one or more of their million-dollar estates.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bethenny Frankel Defends Herself Amid Backlash For Flaunting $2 Million Engagement Ring</a></span></p><p>Following their engagement in May, <a href=#>it was reported that attorneys were already working on a prenup</a> in June.</p><p>Bezos is currently the world’s third richest person. He owes much of his $149 billion fortune to being the founder and CEO of Amazon, which he turned into the world’s biggest online retailer. Lauren, a former Emmy-winning broadcast journalist and helicopter pilot, <a href=#>has a reported $40 million net worth</a>.</p><p>The pair, who’ve been together since meeting in 2018 when Lauren was hired through her company Back Ops Aviation to film aerial footage for Jeff, already own joint assets. This includes a $78 million estate purchased in Maui in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the price of Lauren’s 20-carat engagement ring isn’t known, it’s estimated to be worth a small fortune, as well, which is likely covered in the prenup.</p><p>Jeff popped the question in May while the pair were sailing on the Mediterranean sea aboard his $500 million super yacht. “They were all over each other. I mean, they’re always affectionate, but they could not keep their hands off each other,” <a href=#>a witness said at the time</a>.</p><p>“They were telling everyone they were engaged, they were so excited, they are completely in love,” they went on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This will be Jeff’s second marriage. He was previously ed to MacKenzie Scott from 1993 to 2019 (though they had separated year prior). The exes share three children. They reportedly didn’t have a prenup, which made their divorce tricky, especially since MaKenzie had stakes in Amazon.</p><p>She eventually walked away with a $36 billion divorce settlement, which she’s pledged to donate to charity.</p><p>MaKenzie has also been remarried. Shew ed Seattle high school teacher Dan Jewett in 2021, <a href=#>only to divorce earlier this year</a>. The pair signed a prenup that didn’t entitle him to her fortune.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tia Mowry Wins Divorce As Court Decides She Won’t Have To Pay Child & Spousal Support</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbXSZqCsZZikxG651JyfZqWfo7K6ecuarKudnmLAorrCoZyzZaeeua15xp6rZqGeYrWmvoypqZ6mpaV6uLXToWSjnZabeqOx2aiqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

She has been featured in campaigns by a number of major brands, including Jimmy Choo, Escada, Giorgio Armani, Michael Kors, and Chanel, Molly Sims’ happy place, she says. The model turned actor purchased her first-ever home there in 1999, and when she married movie producer (and now Netflix head of global film) Scott Stuber in 2011, she told him, “I’m never giving up the Hamptons.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Molly Sims Classic Los Angeles Home</b></a></span></p><p>Happiness is meant to be shared, so in 2018 the couple purchased a piece of land in Sagaponack, New York, to build a dream home with plenty of room for friends and family to come visit. Four years of construction delays and endless Zoom calls later, Sims, Stuber, and their three children (10-year-old Brooks, seven-year-old Scarlett, and five-year-old Grey) finally enjoyed a summer at the retreat.</p><p>The <i>Lipstick on the Rim</i> podcast host enlisted designer Dan Scotti, who did the family’s previous Hamptons pad, for the project. Scotti brought in architect Raymond Renault, and together they created a home that blends quintessential Hamptons shingle-style architecture with sleek modernism. (Sims asked her friend, Mimi Brown, to help with interior design, and AD100 designer Brigette Romanek, to help with the design of the bathrooms and powder room.) The dwelling consists of multiple structures with gabled roofs connected by flat-topped glass breezeways. To the west is a two-bedroom guest wing “so a whole family could have their privacy away from everyone else,” Sims says. In the center is a large room that Sims calls the bar, but which is really more of a salon with a full bar. Finally, forming an L-shape area is the section that houses the family’s main living spaces, per<a href=#><i> Architectural Digest.</i></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here, the open-concept kitchen, dining room, and sunken living room take up most of the first floor, with an entire wall of glass putting the outdoor space by LaGuardia Design Group on full display. “I knew that the kitchen had to be the biggest room in the whole house because everybody’s always in the kitchen. Pretty much the whole house lends itself to entertaining and being outside,” Sims says.</p><p>Interiors were on Scotti and Sims’s minds from “day one” of the building process, says Scotti, who sourced or designed many pieces of custom furniture for perfect fit and durability. Many indoor pieces were upholstered with outdoor fabric to protect against damage from popsicle-wielding kids fresh from the pool. Many other pieces are vintage collectibles purchased from 1stDibs or Wyeth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Throughout most of the first floor, we kept the color palette relatively neutral so that your eye would be drawn to the artwork and out to the gardens,” Scotti says. Cream and white tones are everywhere, but the abundance of white oak in the home adds warmth. Plus there’s plenty of texture thanks to custom-made rugs and rich fabrics. An engaged art collector, Sims commissioned multiple original pieces for the home, like a painting by Jonathan Ryan made of sand (“Everyone tries to touch it,” Sims says), a Matthew Brandt diptych, and a neon sign by Olivia Steele.</p><p>The neon piece takes up the entire wall above the dining table—Scotti says they even moved a pantry door to make way for it—and reads, “This is where it gets interesting….” To Sims, the saying is a nod to how domestic life unfolds. “Sometimes you climb the mountain, sometimes you’re going down the mountain,” she says. “But I think it just encompasses our life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Architectural Digest.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipqOesaZ5zp9kpqecocZuv8imqmaepaG5unnCrqqtp52ex6awjKGYpqikpLu0ecGemJygXZ28tr%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

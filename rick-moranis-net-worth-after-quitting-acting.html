While <a href=#>Disney was uncertain about the film</a>, it became a hit and led to two sequels. However, as fans sadly know, Moranis <strong>stopped acting when his wife passed away from cancer in 1991</strong>. Rather than juggle work and family at this devastating and tragic time, Moranis focused on taking care of their two children Rachel and Mitchell. Thanks to this choice and his general reputation in Hollywood, fans know that <a href=#>Moranis is a kind person</a>.</p><p>Over the years, Ghostbusters star Rick Moranis has been photographed out and about in New York City, and fans were shocked when he was attacked in 2020. Thankfully, the actor was okay, and he has been doing well for several decades now. In this article, we'll take a look at how <strong>Rick Moranis's net worth </strong>has given him a comfortable lifestyle, along with the ways that he has <strong>kept making money despite not playing many movie roles</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-rick-moranis-39-s-net-worth>What Is Rick Moranis's Net Worth?</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <strong>Rick Moranis</strong><strong>has a $10 million net worth</strong>. Thanks to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor's high net worth</a>, he has been able to support himself and his family, even though his resume has been pretty bare for several decades now.</p><p>While some actors star in one popular TV series and make enough money to leave the business behind, Rick Moranis had plenty of high-profile movie roles that gave him a nice cushion to mostly stop acting after the late 1990s. In the 1980s, he performed on SCTV and SCTV Network, which gave him a public platform to showcase his comedic talent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/honey-i-shrunk-the-kids-marcia-strassman-rick-moranis.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Rick Moranis has millions and has definitely made a nice living from acting, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about his family and acting roles</a> with The Independent in 2006 he <strong>wasn't sure he would become a rich and famous actor</strong>. He said:</p><p>"In Canada you don't think that show business is an opportunity for you. You think it's something that happens across the border.

This meant that he could keep making money and adding to his net worth in terms of residuals.

Josh Gad is also co-starring. According to IMDb, Shrunk has a 2024 release date. Although he didn't take on any live-action roles for a long time, Moranis must have been paid a lot considering how important he is to the children's franchise.</p><p>However, as of the time of this writing, it might be a while before fans get to see Shrunk. In June 2023, Josh Gad tweeted, "We were inches from starting and then COVID hit, inches from starting again & then my schedule exploded with conflicts, inches from starting again & budget got the best of us.

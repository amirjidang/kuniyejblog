The model recently announced she’s the new <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Director</a> of FWRD.&nbsp;Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, Kendall shared a black-and-white photo of herself sitting on a couch with a sultry glare. But it was the caption that caught the attention of the model’s 188 million followers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Anka To Continue With Sold-Out Tour Despite Coronavirus Concerns</a></span></p><p>Describing herself as a “lover of fashion” and reminiscing on the years of experience she’s gained working in the modeling industry, Kendall said she’s excited to take on the role of FWRD’s Creative Director. In the post, she said she’d be directly responsible for helping “curate the site’s offering with emerging designers and brands.”</p><p>FWRD left a comment via their official Instagram account on Kendall’s post, writing, “Couldn’t be more excited,” followed by heart emojis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The brand aims to revolutionize online shopping</a> by providing first-class service and famous designers, all virtually. The online luxury retailer was founded in 2012 by Elyse Walker, who has owned and operated clothing boutiques since the ‘90s. FWRD hosts a handful of designers, including Givenchy, Chloe, and <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saint Laurent</a>.</p><p>FWRD already has a section on their website dedicated to its new Creative Director, titled <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Kendall’s Edit.'</a> Visitors can take a look at Kendall's modeling for the newest designs and review her top picks for the season. FWRD also included the same photo Kendall shared on social media to announce the collaboration alongside a quote from the model that’s almost similar to the caption she used in the Instagram post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, Kendall begins her job the week of September 8th, when New York Fashion Week kicks off. In addition to overseeing the look and feel of the website, the position will also “involve brand activations and marketing,” the outlet reports.</p><p>Kendall opened up to Vogue about the new job, which she described as, “[An] <strong>additional step in my journey with fashion, where I can work with the brands and creative teams I have admitted in fresh, new ways</strong> .”</p><p>FRWRD isn’t just focused on luxury clothing. With Kendall’s direction, the model hopes to incorporate more independent and up-and-coming designers onto the online platform. Kendall explained she’s a firm believer in mixing designer pieces with street style. The <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping Up with the Kardashians </a>alum adds that she believes this will be an opportunity for “emerging creatives” to utilize the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendall is one of the most sought-after models in the industry. In 2017, for instance, she was named the highest-paid model of the year by Forbes. She’s estimated to have a net worth upwards of $45 million, and owing to her new position with FRWD, this number is likely to increase.</p><p>NEXT: <a href=#>Former Child Star Brock Pierce Transforms Vintage Yacht Into Luxury Hotel</a></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram @kendalljenner</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FRWD</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAtrzEq6SonJWheqyxzZ2YpaRdn7KvusSrZK2Zm5rAbrvNZphmppWseqSt0Z6cq2WTna6tuMSnnp5lkah6tbTEZpqrnZGptrexjJ2gq52Tqbyzec6fZJ%2Bvopl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

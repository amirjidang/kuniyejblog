Sharon was asked about her stance on the “White Lives Matter” shirt Kanye wore to a Yeezy show during Paris Fashion week.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tia Mowry Challenges Spousal Support Amid Divorce From Cory Hardrict</a></span></p><p>She was also questioned about Kanye’s controversial stance on BLM. The publication says she “perked right up” when the photographer said Kanye said BLM is a “scam.”</p><p>Sharon told the reporter that she and her husband Ozzy Osbourne gave $900,000 to BLM. However, now “[she] told us she would like her money back and wishes Kanye spoke out before they cut the check,” TMZ said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sharon added that she doesn’t believe Kanye should be “canceled” over the “White Lives Matter” t-shirt. The former America’s Got Talent judge said people should ignore him if they don’t like this behavior.</p><p>Sharon has come under fire in the past for racially insensitive behavior. In 2021, it was reported that she used several racial slurs to refer to Julie Chen, her former co-host on The Talk.</p><p>The report said Sharon specifically referred to Julie as a "wonton" and having "slanty eyes.”</p><p>The television personality later addressed the claims, but she neither denied them nor apologized. Rather, she defended the comments.</p><p>"<a href=#>Everyone's got an opinion</a> or a story like the wonton story. It's like f--- off with your f------ wonton story. F--- off!” she said. "Of course, it's a pile on. People want to add fuel to the fire and it comes with the territory and that's fine."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after, The Talk revealed it was looking into the claims.</p><p>Sharon ultimately left The View after a heated on-air conversation with Cheryl Underwood in which she defended Piers Morgan's comments about Meghan Markle, which launched an investigation. It was announced in March 2021 she was departing the show.</p><p>“<a href=#>Sharon Osbourne has decided</a> to leave The Talk,” CBS said in a statement. “The events of the March 10 broadcast were upsetting to everyone involved, including the audience watching at home. As part of our review, we concluded that Sharon’s behavior toward her co-hosts during the March 10 episode did not align with our values for a respectful workplace.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>50 Cent’s Son Says $80,000/Year in Child Support Wasn’t Enough</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAqa3RqKVmp6OXvLa%2BzZ5knZ2dlrulv4xyZ2loYGV6pbvNmquip55iwbB5waWkZpqVYr%2BmwNSrpZ6cXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

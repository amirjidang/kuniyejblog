From his <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ten-year clothing deal with GAP</a> to his <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 campaign</a> to take over the Oval Office, Kanye West always has something in the middle while he's cooking up the next Billboard Top 100 hit song.</p><p>Now, fresh off the heels of his massively well-received album Donda, it looks like Kanye's setting out for his next big business venture: starting his very own line of homeware products.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanye West Drums Up Millions At Donda's Third Event, Before Album Even Drops</a></span></p><p>West is no stranger to the finer aspects of interior design. He displayed his keen eye for decorating a space when he designed his ex-wife Kim Kardashian's Hidden Hills estate.</p><p>So it's only right that he's directing his attention towards <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">producing luxury home items</a>. West's company, Mascotte Holdings, Inc, recently filed a trademark application to start up the homeware line under the name of "Kanye West".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to documents obtained by <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, the first to break the exclusive story, the line will include "shower curtains, textile wall hangings, towels, placemats and blankets."</p><p>The documents suggest that blankets will be a big selling point of the line potential catalog. From blankets for the shower to blankets for the bedroom, the paperwork shows that West is looking to dominate the blanket game. The documents go on to include potential fabrics like cashmere and fleece.</p><p>Though, it looks like West isn't the only celeb looking to get into the home decor business. In September of last year, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">then-wife Kim</a> filed for the trademark "KKW Home" in an effort to sell her own luxury household essentials. She's looking to get her own bath and shower products on the shelves. Though when the couple separated earlier this year, she opted for a different name - "SKNN BY KIM".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of being one of the most streamed artists in the world, West has gained his <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.8 billion net worth</a> from a number of different ventures over the years. Just last year, his Yeezy shoes brought in sales of around $1.7 billion. Also, in 2020, West signed a deal with GAP, and the Yeezy clothing line hit the shelves.</p><p>We'll just have to wait and see if the 'Kanye West' homeware line lives up to his billion-dollar potential.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:<a href=#>&nbsp;Lil Yeezy: Kanye West Before Fame</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big News Network&nbsp;</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTGprHZsmShp52axKK%2BxGaimqapmnq4sdKtqmalkaiwsMDTnmShp5yZtq%2Bz0magp5tdmsamv4ytpmakkaq7pLSMmmSloZ6aerCyjKGmpp2nlr%2Bmec%2Brpp2tk6nAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

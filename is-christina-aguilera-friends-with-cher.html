The film featured pop singer Christina Aguilera and musical icon Cher. It was released in 2010 and recently celebrated its ten-year anniversary. Fans are curious to know if after all these years Christina Aguilera and Cher are still friends. Read on to find out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-impact-of-the-39-burlesque-39-movie>The Impact Of The 'Burlesque' Movie</h2><p>The 2010 American musical burlesque received mixed film reviews. Although it was praised for the cast and the music, the plot was called cliché. The soundtrack, however, received two nominations at the 54th Grammy Awards. Cher's performance of the song You Haven’t Seen The Last Of Me from the film, was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for the best original song back in 2011.</p><p>The film itself was also nominated for Best Motion Picture for a musical or comedy category at the Golden Globe Awards the same year, and won the best original song category for Cher's performance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The True Origin Of Christina Aguilera's 'Burlesque'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This film marked Christina Aguilera’s first acting debut and Cher's first musical debut. Burlesque was certainly a milestone for both musicians. The film follows Christina Aguilera’s character Ali Rose, who leaves her small town to pursue her dreams in Los Angeles as a singer. She lands a job at a burlesque lounge, which is owned by Cher’s character Tess. In order to restore the club's former success, Aguilera’s character puts on performances with the help of Cher’s character.</p><p>Although the film received mixed reviews it still gained nearly $100 million at the box office. It was nominated for quite a lot of awards and won a handful of them. Including Best Original Song at the Satellite Awards and soundtrack of the year at the Japan Gold Disc Awards in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cher-and-aguilera-39-s-friendship>Cher and Aguilera's Friendship</h2><p>When too extremely successful and iconic musicians work together on a film it is no surprise that fans become invested in their relationship outside the film. Back in 2010, Aguilera actually said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“I’m close friends with Cher".</a> After the movie, they spent a lot of time together, but now twelve years have passed, and the big question is do they still keep in touch, and are they even friends?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Cher Was Cast In Christina Aguilera's 'Burlesque'</a></span></p><p>As the ten-anniversary of burlesque was celebrated in 2020, Aguilera took to Instagram to share a post about it. She posted a video of the film with the caption "cheers to 10 years of burlesque." She also said she holds this film close to her heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Aguilera follows Cher on Instagram, Cher does not follow her back and did not react to Aguilera’s post. Cher also did not post anything herself about the ten-year anniversary. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that they aren’t friends. It is actually quite unclear if the two keep in touch.</p><p>Even if they don’t, it doesn’t mean there is any bad blood between the two. Christina has also stated in the past that Cher has her respect and that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was star-struck when she first met her.</a></p><h2 id=where-are-the-two-in-their-careers-currently>Where Are The Two In Their Careers Currently?</h2><p>Cher was of course known for her fame in the 60s and 70s. Recently Cher's ex-husband's widow has decided that the royalties of all of their music belong solely to her. <a href=#>This is leaving Cher without anything for herself </a>even though the money is coming from the music of Sonny & Cher.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are Christina Aguilera's Best-Selling Albums</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems there still has not been a clear answer as to who will get the money. Something else Cher has been up to is being extremely vocal in politics. She is doing as much as she can for the Ukrainian refugees amid the Russian invasion. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She has even gone as far as to offer her home to Ukrainian refugees,</a> and she urges other celebrities to step up to the plate as well.</p><p>Christina has certainly had an amazing career.<a href=#> Fans say she "made her own way</a>," and it's clear she has been an advocate for herself during her career journey. It was announced in early 2022 that she will be headlining LA pride this summer (she has been a long-time LGBTQ activist and ally). She will also be headlining the world fair's Jubilee Stage as part of the closing ceremony. And Christina recently <a href=#>attended a Billboard award event, going topless</a> underneath a sleek two-piece black suit, of course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although It is unclear whether Christina Aguilera and Cher still keep in touch after the 2010 Burlesque movie. It is clear that the two are still working hard on their own careers, and it's possible they'll cross paths again.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Did Christina Aguilera Make Most Of Her Money?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWTnb%2Bqv9OipZplkZzCqrjEq5hmnqKesq%2Bw0mauoqyYYrCpsdFo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

To suggest that Taylor has been waiting around for a guy — any guy — to fulfill an assumed life dream of getting married and having babies seems way off, especially considering Taylor's commentary on the subject over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-9.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Ex Joe Alwyn Is Worried About Her New Relationship With Travis Kelce">Taylor Swift’s Ex Joe Alwyn Is Worried About Her New Relationship With Travis Kelce</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor is acting differently in her relationship with Travis Kelce and people are beginning to notice.</p><p>Whether she wants kids or not, it seems disingenuous to suggest that Taylor Swift, of all people, has been waiting around for a man, let alone one to have kids with.</p><p>While only time will tell whether Taylor does want marriage and babies with Travis Kelce, it's just as safe to assume she doesn't want kids at all — and the media doesn't get to decide that for her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lpKeut7XSZqKepJOaeqOtwbJkq62dpL%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

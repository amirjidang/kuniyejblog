During their time isolated in the house, Big Brother's cast members form deep friendships. This only makes the gameplay at hand even more treacherous as friends begin targeting friends. It also makes it rather hard not to become invested in the relationships of these new reality stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=todrick-hall-hosted-a-watch-party-for-the-big-brother-24-cast><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Todrick Hall Hosted A Watch Party For The Big Brother 24 Cast</span></h2><p>Todrick Hall is a huge Big Brother fan. As well is a new member of the BB family, as he starred in the 2022 season of CelebrityBig Brother. <a href=#>Fans and cast mates weren't happy with the singer and choreographer's gameplay</a>, however, deeming him a bully. Nearly nine months later, Todrick hasn't let the negative response to his gameplay dilute his love of the game.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Todrick Hall Doesn't Care If You Thought He Was Mean On Celebrity Big Brother 2022</a></span></p><p>He happily took over hosting duties as this year's cast left the Big Brother house. After the finale, he invited them to watch the first few episodes of their Big Brother season. It seems a few cast members even stayed multiple days with Todrick after leaving the show</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-durston-reflected-on-his-gameplay><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Daniel Durston Reflected On His Gameplay</span></h2><p>Daniel came out of the house prior to jury and with a lot of negative attention headed his way from fans. Daniel was pinpointed as one of the main bullies behind the campaign to get rid of Taylor. Fans wanted Daniel to answer for his actions when he left the house.</p><p>Daniel Durston <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has spoken about how helpful Todrick was in his transition back into the real world</a> after the game. Having both gained heat from the public for their actions in the house, Todrick was able to give Daniel some first-hand advice on how to handle the trolls while also looking into his own actions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-winner-taylor-hale-amp-monte-pursue-a-relationship-outside-the-house><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Did Winner Taylor Hale & Monte Pursue A Relationship Outside The House?</span></h2><p>Fans were shocked when Taylor and Monte's friendship turned romantic in the house. The two had remained steadfast in their goal of reaching the end of the game without distraction. But after making it to the final three, things turned romantic between the two game players. What shocked fans the most was the history between the two, with Monte being a driving force behind the bullying Taylor received from house guests in the early days on the game.</p><p>Their romance ended nearly as soon as it started, however, never making it out of the Big Brother house. During interviews after the show, when asked about the two of them Taylor didn't hold back the truth. She admitted that Monte was a second, temporary showmance after Joseph left.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Big Brother: The 10 Best Showmances Of All Time</a></span></p><p>She also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">voiced her frustration about the way Monte spoke about her in the game</a> and his lack of ownership for his actions towards her. Fans of Taylor and Joseph's flirtations were left heartbroken, sure that the two wouldn't be able to rekindle their romance after Monte's involvement. However, it seems like we may have jumped to conclusions too soon.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-taylor-hale-and-joseph-abdin><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Happened To Taylor Hale And Joseph Abdin?</span></h2><p>Taylor suffered horrible treatment from her housemates during her first few weeks of the game. But her resiliency along with her great game play made her a fan favorite. She became a champion for truth, honesty, and forgiveness in the game. We saw her not only reconcile with the house guests who bullied her, but form friendships with them as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was one house guest, however, who immediately took to rooting for Taylor to win - Joseph Abdin. The two quickly hit it off and were nearly always spotted together in the house prior to Joseph's eviction. After the show ended, fans were worried about the chances of the pair rekindling their friendship, let alone romance, due to the Monte-Taylor hook-up.</p><p>But it seems Joseph had no hard feelings, picking up with Taylor right where they left off. They've been spending a lot of time together as of late. Most recently they were on Kaitlyn Bristowe's Podcast On The Vine chatting all things Big Brother. Keeping mum about the exact definition of their relationship, Joseph did say that the two know they'll be best friends forever. They're trying to take things slow, but admitted there's definitely a spark between the two of them they can't deny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-brittany-hoopes-after-big-brother-24><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>What Happened To Brittany Hoopes After Big Brother 24?</span></h2><p>After reconnecting with her new Big Brother family in LA, Brittany has made her way back home to Austin, Texas. She's taken time to relax and reset after leaving the game. Currently, she's posting weekly deep dives of her time in the Big Brother house on Instagram. Michael even joined her to chat about their time together as festie-besties. She's also back working as a hypnotist full-time, hosting live group hypnotherapy sessions every Monday via her Instagram.</p><h2 id=did-kyle-and-alyssa-get-back-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Did Kyle And Alyssa Get Back Together?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the revelation of Kyle's racist gameplay (according to TV Line), Alyssa had to take a step-back from the relationship. But it seems that after some time apart, their feelings have grown deeper. After taking time off of social media, Alyssa made her return via Kyle's TikTok. The pair has been spending time together in Florida. Who knows what's next for these two, but for right now it seems they are definitely back on.

The pair were more likely to be caught bickering than talking game strategy, with the catalyst of their distrust towards each other being muffingate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A quick rundown of muffingate - Jasmine saved two muffins for herself and came back into the kitchen to find one half-eaten. After asking everyone in the house who had done it, the culprit was still at large. Little did Jasmine know, it was her partner who had eaten her snack.</p><p>To commemorate muffingate, the pair each got one half of a muffin tattooed on them. They even teased the potential of a podcast from the two of them coming soon. It's nice to know that even after all the drama in the BB house, these two were able to come out as friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZop9dl7%2BwwMeeqWabkajBbn6TZq6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Do The Police Finally Have Answers To Her Unexplained Deat</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dallas-mom-Alyssa-Thomas.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>Alyssa Thomas</strong>, a 32-year-old Dallas mother of three, was laid to rest this weekend.</p><p><strong>Police are investigating her death as unexplained</strong>. Thomas’ friends said they reported her missing earlier this month and then made it their mission to find her.&nbsp;</p><p>Her body was found in a wooded area on March 20th. An autopsy is being conducted to determine <strong>the cause of death.</strong></p><p>Thomas’ friends and family are devastated by her loss and are waiting for answers from authorities.</p><p>Now, a cross and flowers are left behind at the spot in South Dallas where Alyssa’s friend Lavina Brown said “<strong>she and a group of friends found the woman’s body during their own search</strong>” two weeks ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Police have not released the woman’s name, but friends identified her as Thomas. Brown said she believed her friend had been dead for several days when they found her. “<strong>We just wanted to bring some closure to her mom</strong>,” Brown said.&nbsp;</p><p>“<strong>We just wanted her to have some peace</strong>.” The Dallas Police Department is investigating the woman’s death, but no arrests have been made. Police are asking anyone with information to come forward.</p><p>The loss of a parent is always devastating, but it can be especially difficult for children who are left without answers. When a mother goes missing, her children are left wondering what could have happened.&nbsp;</p><p>If she is later found dead, they not only have to deal with the loss of a parent but also with the knowledge that she died under mysterious circumstances.</p><p>This can be an incredibly confusing and painful experience for a child. In addition to the grief and confusion, <strong>they may also feel guilty or responsible for their mother’s death.</strong></p><p>For friends and family members who were involved in the search, there can be a sense of relief that the missing person has been found, but also a great deal of<strong> mourning for the loss of a loved one</strong>. In either case, the sudden and unexpected death of a mother can be devastating for all involved.</p><p>“<strong>I haven’t slept yet. I haven’t closed my eyes</strong>,” Thomas’ friend, Lavina Brown, stated to the police. Brown remembers the long, tiring journey of looking all over North Texas for her friend of more than 10 years.</p><p>She also states that she and Alyssa have been friends for more than 10 years and she had made it her mission to <strong>find her wherever she was.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>She also recalls the long and tiring journey when she along with other groups of friends were looking all over North Texas for their friend.&nbsp;</p><p>Lavina said that she couldn’t imagine that this could be Alyssa’s final moments. From handing out flyers to every gas station pump to extensively searching the whole area.</p><p>She even said that<strong> if you ever pull up, you will definitely see her.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Search</h2><p>Brown said the last time she spoke to Thomas was on September 29th. By October 3rd, Thomas had been reported missing to Dallas police.</p><p>Brown said, “<strong>Thomas borrowed her roommate’s car that weekend.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So Brown and others tried to retrace Thomas’ steps using location data from the car. They searched remote locations in Mansfield, Rowlett, Garland, and Dallas. “<strong>From the 3rd, the 4th, 5th, 6th of October</strong>,” Brown recalled.</p><p>“<strong>By the 6th, we got a call that they located the vehicle</strong>.” Brown wants to know what happened to her friend and why.</p><p>Since October 4th, the rented white Kia had been parked at a storage area.</p><p>Brown claimed to have found out that<strong> the car had been towed from an Addison location.</strong></p><p>Thus, Brown and her companions had access to security footage taken that evening when the Kia was towed.</p><p>Two people Brown didn’t recognize got out of the white Kia after it pulled into the parking lot in the footage Brown gave FOX 4.</p><p>There was no sign of Thomas. According to Brown, “<strong>they both break up and head in different places.</strong>” Thomas’ corpse was still missing at that point.</p><p>After that, on October 15th, Brown and some pals searched a barren property off Cedardale Drive, close to I-20 and Bonnie View, which was one of the last places the white Kia was detected.</p><p>Brown remembered, “<strong>And I just froze</strong>.”</p><p>Nearly naked, Brown discovered Thomas’ remains in the underbrush about a mile away.</p><p>Alyssa Thomas’ identity was confirmed by the medical examiner, but her cause of death has not yet been determined.</p><p>According to Dallas police, they are looking into this death as being <strong>mysterious.</strong></p><p>“<strong>I only want Alyssa to receive justice. I won’t give up until Alyssa has justice</strong>, “Black said.</p><p>Brown claimed that she is attempting to obtain information by speaking with police in Addison, Rowlett, and Dallas.</p><p>Two twins who are 13 years old and an 11-year-old are among Thomas’s three children.</p><p><strong>Her funeral was held on Saturday, where she was laid to rest.</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwwKWjmqtdoryuecClsKyrkWLBqbvMmqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

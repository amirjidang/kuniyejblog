The people are beautiful, the drama is rich, and it all takes place in a classy atmosphere, what’s not to enjoy when sitting down during the weekend and watching a non-stop marathon of every season!?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But in all seriousness, today we’re going to be focusing on Lala Kent—the girl who everyone is talking about non-stop when it comes to reality TV at the moment. She’s somewhat new to the show and many people have mixed opinions about her. Many people within the show openly talk about how much they don’t like Lala Kent, while many tabloids are labeling her as a feminist savior. Some might sum up how the other cast members of the show treat Kent as a sort of initiation to their little club, but it’s so much more than that and pretty harsh if we say so ourselves. On top of it all, Lala Kent doesn’t care about what people think of her, she acts as if she’s above it all and she doesn’t stoop to drama, which ironically causes drama with the other cast.</p><p>By going through this article, we hope to explore the reasons why so many hate Lala Kent and moments from her past that people throw in her face. Hopefully, this will help us understand this dynamic character a bit more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-fake-modelling-shoots>Her “Fake” Modelling Shoots</h2><p>Many of the cast on <i>Vanderpump Rules</i> like to stir up drama and act as if they’re on top and the most popular. This is especially the case with individuals such as Scheana and Katie, who have openly mocked and poked fun at the fact that Lala Kent shows off her body doing modeling shoots. But there’s apparently more to the reasoning behind this problem. Just because Lala Kent posts a ton of selfies and pictures of her where she seems to be putting on a face for modeling, many of the cast mock her for it, treating her like she’s just a fake model. But they have failed to realize that there’s nothing wrong with being confident in a selfie. Just because the quality of the picture is lower or it’s taken on a cell phone, doesn’t mean she can’t post it when she wants to. But apparently, since she’s a model, she needs to look like one 24/7. Who knows the real reason behind this kind of absurd bullying, but it’s really strange and uncalled for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-stays-away-from-drama>She Stays Away From Drama</h2><p>One of the biggest reasons the cast and viewers seem to have a problem with Lala Kent is the fact that she often tries to stay away from the drama, which like we mentioned before, makes it worse because it makes others feel as if she feels better than them on some level when this isn’t even the case. Lala Kent just wants to live her best life and stay out of the drama, but no matter what she does, the cast and viewers just want to push her as far as they can because they want to see her snap and break the peaceful character she puts on. She still manages to be successful on the show without having to rely on drama to keep her relevant like some cast members seem to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-flaunts-her-stuff>She&nbsp;Flaunts Her Stuff&nbsp;</h2><p>Back to Scheana and Katie— they seem to always act as if they are at the top of the list when it comes to popularity, especially when it comes to Lala Kent. So when they went to Hawaii with some other members of their cast, Lala Kent decided to not wear her bikini top since she’s comfortable with her body and they’re all adults. According to Bravo TV, she refers this decision now, even though she wasn’t going out of her way to cause a scene, it was natural and she was just having a great time. But both Katie and Scheana were disgusted, even some of the guys called her some names. It’s never right to make fun of someone for being comfortable and confident.&nbsp;Lala told Bravo TV that she felt attacked after the incident.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=she-s-in-charge-of-her-body>She’s In Charge Of Her Body</h2><p>It’s pretty shocking to see just how much of the cast has turned against her for being in charge of her body.&nbsp;The choices that she makes seem to be something that makes other cast members upset for some reason. Many of the other cast members have used this against Lala Kent to make her seem like less of a person. This has also pushed the idea that all women have to be against each other and fighting for the attention of men when that’s never okay and just an overall toxic kind of mindset. This is continually pushed at SUR, but because Lala Kent is okay and comfortable with herself, she’s being constantly brought down about her choices and her own sense of self, which is always messed up on any level. Maybe the cast will grow up at some point in their lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-changed-her-look-up-a-lot>She Has Changed Her Look Up A Lot&nbsp;</h2><p>One of the big reasons why many people DO have a love for Lala Kent is the fact that she embraces anyone and everyone. She is very pro-choice when it comes to being a woman. Whether she wants to support other women, feminism, body positivity, or even beauty enhancements, she makes it clear that it should remain the right of anyone to make the choices they want to see in their own life. This has had many viewers split about Lala Kent. Some conservative individuals disapprove of this thought process, while many modern and forward thinking individuals support her sense of freedom and confidence in every step she takes. She’s someone you can’t put a stop to— no matter what!</p><p>She once said, "I'm not the type of person who's going to walk out and be like, 'I've had nothing done! My face just changed like this, I'm pretty open about things like that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-makes-her-friends-sign-ndas>She Makes Her Friends Sign NDAs</h2><p>An additional reason why many individuals from SUR have had a problem with Lala Kent is&nbsp;that she allegedly makes her friends sign an NDA, a.k.a. a nondisclosure agreement. Some people understand why she would do this, especially since she is famous and needs to be cautious about who she allows into her personal life, but this has also put some relationships with cast members on edge because they think it’s her saying she doesn’t trust them. But Lala Kent doesn’t seem to care what people say whatsoever and continues to be cautious. After all, it’s better to be safe than sorry! One thing that has spawned from this that has caused many to love Lala Kent, even more, is the fact that she doesn’t care what people think about her. If someone doesn’t want to sign an NDA to hang out with her, they don’t need to hang out with her. At the end of the day, Lala Kent won’t care and she’ll still be enjoying her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-doesn-t-put-up-with-jax>She Doesn't Put Up With Jax&nbsp;</h2><p>One thing that the show has proven time and time again is that she does not approve of how the men on the show treat everyone else. Lala Kent has taken it upon herself to express that she doesn’t care what people think and she will let people know that, especially if they are getting involved with drama like this. The issues that have caused the most drama on the show mostly come from Jax, and Lala doesn’t care about his reputation and how important he is to the show.&nbsp;She’s taken it upon herself to let him know what she thinks. According to Bustle, she has shared a recording of proof, revealing that Jax doesn’t even appreciate his own relationship. She did that to help her friend! Many thought Lala was mean for this, but wouldn’t you want a friend to tell you the truth if your BF was trash talking you?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-stands-up-for-her-friends>She Stands Up For Her Friends</h2><p>Speaking of not putting up with the stuff that men get away with on the show, Lala has time and time again shown many of the people working with her that she will not tolerate their behavior. She has stood up many times to the cast, especially the men on the show and told them exactly what she thinks about their scummy behavior. People posted a video in which Lala Kent told Jax that "[they] see right through [him]." She’s done this to protect the girls on the show, even when they themselves have been mean to Lala Kent! Talk about standing up for what you believe in and being the bigger person. Maybe after exposing so many of the guys on the show she will teach everyone a lesson so people can actually behave better!</p><p>She’s even said to Andy Cohen on his show, “God forbid women stand together. We're not going to deal with your [garbage], I'm so sick of these guys thinking they can get away with whatever [they want]!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-actually-grew-up-in-utah>She Actually Grew&nbsp;Up In Utah</h2><p>Many people have this idea about her that she’s a goody two shoes because she grew up in Utah and moved to LA later on in her life. Many people see her as just that girl trying to reach her Hollywood dreams, but in reality, she’s so much more than that— she’s a woman who is focusing on her career.</p><p>She has told Heavy in a past interview, “I’m from Salt Lake City. It’s a very religious driven state, which I never got used to, I grew up in a very open home. We talked about literally everything— we still do, which sometimes my dad is like, okay I don’t need to know EVERYTHING! My family is extremely close. I don’t have family in Utah except for immediate family so it is kind of like “we all we got!”&nbsp;While she might be a girl from Utah, that’s not all she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-name-drops-every-chance-she-gets>She Name Drops Every Chance She Gets</h2><p>Since she started working as a model in many ways, Lala Kent has gotten to know a few people quite well— such as David Spade. These connections have also made cast members and other individuals in the industry a bit envious of how far she’s come in her career. She knows how to handle meeting celebs in the industry, which might also make people jealous since individuals sometimes are just known for their bad reputation and don’t get as many chances to meet new people and potential individuals to work with on future projects. She’s even said before that she’s become close friends with David Spade, and has gotten acting jobs from that even if acting isn’t entirely her passion. While we wouldn’t complain about seeing Lala Kent on the big screen, we’re sure that kind of attention sometimes must bother her other cast members who want the attention as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rumors-with-randall-emmett>The Rumors With Randall Emmett</h2><p>There have been so many rumors swirling around about who Lala Kent is dating,&nbsp;which has been something she doesn’t want people talking about on Vanderpump Rules. It’s even made her break that nice character of her’s when asked about the scandal on the reunion show with Andy Cohen. She broke down, got defensive, and told everyone to leave her man out of the situation. There are alleged rumors that Lala Kent has been dating Randall Emmett, who was married at the time of the rumors began. While it’s unconfirmed from many sources, it doesn’t stop people from paying major attention to this tarnished past that she’s been trying to hide. She’s even called other cast members of the show bullies because they constantly pester her about this rumor and she’s just over it. Who knows what will actually come of this and their “relationship," we hope to find out more soon, but she constantly keeps her personal life locked up tight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=more-ndas-at-coachella>More NDAs At Coachella</h2><p>Lala Kent really annoyed a ton of people&nbsp;by continuing to push NDAs on individuals who went to Coachella with her. While this isn’t confirmed, it has popped up quite a bit because of how sick of it people were. Many people just wanted to go with her to have fun, but the paperwork really dragged the mood down. Her continuously pushing this kind of thing on the people around her seems as if she’s pushing people away from her by being so paranoid. There’s nothing good about being super paranoid in Hollywood because people will always be looking for when you mess up. But when you think you’re protecting yourself, in reality, you’re just drawing so much more attention to the situation,&nbsp;which makes it seem as if she has something to hide. Maybe she does have something to hide?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-not-really-the-social-type>She’s Not Really The Social Type</h2><p>Despite her being a star on reality TV, a model, and an actress, she’s not exactly one of the most social individuals in the industry. She apparently likes to stay at home and just watch TV, which is not exactly something most people see when they see her on TV for themselves. She has even thrown a few jabs at herself when she jokes around and calls herself lazy and just a couch potato. While many don’t judge her for just indulging in what she enjoys doing with her free time, you can’t help but wonder how many other people in the industry actually are like this as well? With someone like Lala Kent, you can’t really judge a book by its cover because she has such a dynamic and unique personality, it’s always going to be a surprise. What else do you think Lala Kent does with her spare time, what shows do you think she watches?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-left-vpr-in-the-middle-of-the-fifth-season>She Left VPR In The Middle Of The Fifth Season</h2><p>Did you know that Lala Kent actually left the <i>Vanderpump Rules</i> TV show during the shooting of the fifth season? Many have assumed that this was because of her rumored boyfriend, while others were just left unsure as to why she left right in the middle of the season so suddenly. Many believe she left the show and was being supported by a sugar daddy (which was likely Emmit) because she lived such a lavish lifestyle and the show couldn’t have been the only thing supporting her. Her absence was short-lived because she ended up coming back to the show in season six, most likely because of the drama she stirred up. While we might not know what exactly happened to explain the leaving and return of Lala Kent to the show, we can assume all we want. But we don’t expect a clear answer anytime soon.</p><h2 id=she-is-a-low-budget-actress>She Is A Low-Budget Actress</h2><p>While many just know Lala Kent from being a hostess on the show, she has been involved in a ton of other projects— from modeling to movies, TV and more! But she did accept roles for some very low-budget projects that have tarnished her name and reputation a bit. While she was involved in these side projects, she still holds her head proudly and she continues to push her career forward with determination from every direction. While some people like to pick on her for being in low-budget projects, look where she is now! Would she be where she is now if she hadn’t worked hard through her career on every project she could get? We really doubt it in all honesty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, Lala Kent is a character that’s unique and tends to be the center of attention when it comes to reality TV at the moment. We’d love to know what you think about this individual and if you’ll be watching Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;this week?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLBqbXNoKpmmZKkwrV5y5qjmmWbmru1v4ypmKysXam1osCMoZivnV2Xsqa6jKucr52RobKledKipZydXZ2ys3nJZqOar12bsrawjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

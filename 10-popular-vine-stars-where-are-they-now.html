Back then, Vine videos were pure comedy, because they required you to be as creative as possible under the time limit. The video-sharing platform propelled some of its biggest stars' careers, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Paul brothers</a>, King Bach, Lele Pons, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘The Voice’ Winners Of The 2010s: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, only two years after hitting 200 million users, Vine was shut down. Since then, many of its stars have migrated to other social media, whether it's YouTube, Instagram, or even the now-growing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>. Here's a little throwback to ten Vine stars and what they've been up to now.</p><h2 id=king-bach><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>King Bach</span></h2><p>Andrew Bachelor, also known as King Bach, rose to stardom for amassing 11.3 million followers on Vine before its defunct. He was the most followed user on the platform. Since then, he'd ventured into acting and made his debut in Black Jesus from 2014 until 2015. Now, he runs a YouTube channel and often posts his day-to-day activities and comedies on TikTok for his 20 million followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zach-king><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Zach King</span></h2><p>While most took comedy's route for their stardom on Vine, Zach King went the extra mile and shot magic. Before its defunct, he joined Vine in September 2013 and quickly rose to millions of followers. Now, like many other former Vine stars, he joined TikTok to spread his magic to over 40 million followers. He made his TV debut this year on an episode of Nickelodeon's Unfiltered.</p><h2 id=lele-pons><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lele Pons</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since her Vine days were over, Lele Pons has been enjoying quite a popularity on social media. She has 43 million followers on Instagram, as well as 23.3 million others on TikTok where she shares behind-the-stage videos of her dancing and her day-to-day life.

Throughout his career, he's been the subject of repeated controversies, including the time when he showed a clip of his trip to the infamous "suicide forest" in Aokigahara, Japan. Now, he's been keeping himself busy with his boxing career and is gearing up for the upcoming "Bragging Rights" fight against Floyd Mayweather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shawn-mendes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Shawn Mendes</span></h2><p>Many may have not known about this, but Shawn Mendes actually had a humble beginning on Vine.

As he rose to stardom with Vine, Disney gave him a contract to star on their Bizaardvark series. His Disney days were short-lived, though, as he later found himself involved with criminal trespassing. He's been focusing on his music career a lot more lately and also boxing here and there.</p><h2 id=liza-koshy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Liza Koshy</span></h2><p>Liza Koshy has found a big jump of success after Vine with her YouTube channel.

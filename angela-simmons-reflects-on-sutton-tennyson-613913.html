At the time of this post, all those connected with the shooting have been identified and no suspects are at large. Atlanta officials believe Tennyson “was shot after a dispute between three people.”</p><p>The news of Sutton’s death came as a shock to the Growing Up Hip-Hop reality star and has left her admittedly “numb.”</p><p>“I’m hurting. I’m numb. Thank you for the outpouring of love everyone. I can’t believe I’m even saying Rest In Peace Sutton.

Moore ended up selling a commissioned drawing to Jason Lurie, a Lawler super fan, who wanted to turn a photo of his&nbsp;niece putting another child into a headlock into a drawing. Lurie says Moore charged him $250 for the initial drawing, and he got photos of lawler posing with the drawing before receiving the finished product, and then wanted another original piece of art from the wrestling legend.</p><p>Lurie says he paid Moore $1,500 via Paypal for an oil painting of his cat, but this is where the problems started as months went by with no finished painting and a number of excuses from Moore. Lurie says he felt something was wrong so he reached out to Lawler on social media, certified mail, and finally got an answer after getting a lawyer involved. The letter informed Lawler about the situation, and that he might be responsible under Tennessee law for failure to return the payment because Moore acted as his agent in the sale.</p><p>Lurie can’t get a refund through Paypal since he used the ‘friends and family’ option for payment, which was advised by Moore. It was noted in the report that a number of other fans were also waiting for autographed items or artwork by Lawler, but never received them from Moore.</p><p>Lawler says his lawyer&nbsp;advised him to file a police report about the matter, but wants his fans to know he will make things right. He says Moore promised to fix this himself, but he has no money, and his behavior changed after losing his job in public relations in December.</p><p>“I’m totally shocked by this behavior,” Lawler said during a phone interview with WMC Action News 5. “I mean, we did like 90 podcasts together over a period of years. This is a guy I thought was a friend and I trusted him. I’m certainly sorry this has happened.”</p><p>“We’re gonna work to try to make this thing right,” he said, “one way or another. Hopefully, we’ll be able to get people’s money back. If not, we’ll get them the artwork they tried to buy.”</p><p>In addition to the WMC report, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bodyslam.net has revealed</a> a number of accounts and screenshots from fans being scammed by Moore. Since the original report was aired last night, they have <a href=# rel=noopener>had more fans reach out including Lurie</a>, who provided further details about his interactions with Moore and how the case has been going since hiring legal help. Lurie told Bodyslam that he waited nine months for a refund for the oil painting, and including court costs, he’s looking at a total loss of $2250. He says his story is just like the other victims who were scammed by Moore, but the lawyers have been dealing with this for months and hopes Lawler will just make things right with the fans first before going after Moore in court. He added that there are “lots of holes in the story that need to be filed in” but they are making progress with the case.</p><p>Lawler will be returning to the airwaves with a new podcast, The Jerry Lawler Show, next week with Sean Reedy as his new co-host.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBqZ25tZ2K3pr7RsmSlmaehsrO%2FjJ%2Bmq6WVp3qxrdGtpZ6qXZy5prrNZqSop6KaerSvwKakoqaXYrOiutI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

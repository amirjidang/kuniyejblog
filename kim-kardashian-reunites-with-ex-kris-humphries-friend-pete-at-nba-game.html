Kardashian and Cornell, 47, looked friendly as they chatted and laughed together. It was certainly a blast from the past, given that the real estate agent was a groomsman at the former couple’s wedding.</p><p class=p1>Kardashian and Humphries, 39, began <a href=#>their whirlwind romance</a> in October 2010. They got engaged seven months later, tying the knot in August 2011. Kardashian famously filed for divorce after 72 days of marriage.</p><p class=p1>The fashion mogul<a href=#> reflected back</a> on their relationship while appearing on the <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> reunion special in 2021, admitting that she felt “pressure” to go through with the nuptials.</p><p class=p1>“I thought I was going to let everyone down,” she said. “The show paid us, obviously, a fee to film the show. I took my entire fee and probably Kris’ [fee] because I wanted a bigger wedding than what they were going to pay for. So I used all of our production money on the wedding. So, if that was, like, fake, I would have saved my money!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Kim-Kardashian-Had-a-Surprise-Reunion-With-Ex-Kris-Humphries-Friend-Pete-Cornell-2.jpg><p class=p1>Kardashian noted that she tried to apologize to her ex for “months” after <a href=#>filing for divorce</a>. Years later, she ran into the athlete in Los Angeles — and he wouldn’t even acknowledge her.</p><p class=p1>“All of his friends got up and said hi to me. He just literally looked at me and wouldn’t even speak to me,” she said. “He’s very faith-based, and so, I’m sure he would have loved to not have marriage on his record. He wanted an annulment. The only legal way to get an annulment is if fraud is involved, so he marked fraud to get an annulment. So the whole world wondered, ‘What is this fraud?’ … If I was mature, I would have wanted the annulment too.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The former NBA player previously <a href=# rel=noopener>offered his own take</a> on the breakup, opening up in a 2019 essay for <i>The Players’ Tribune</i>.

The duo, who <a href=#>married in 2014</a>, share four children: North, 10, Chicago, 6, Saint, 8, and Psalm, 4. They split in 2022. Humphries, for his part, appears to be single at the moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3qzsdSnoK2do2LEqsDHZpyxZZuntrR5x66kqaCinrK0ecWroJ6mlGK9psDEZpitZZ6Xrm6zwKacaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

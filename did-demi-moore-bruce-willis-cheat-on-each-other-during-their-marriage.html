It's said to be "impacting his cognitive abilities," said a statement released by his ex Demi Moore, <a href=#>wife Emma Heming</a>, and his daughters Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel, and Evelyn. They added that they're "moving through this as a strong family unit."Fans have always admired Moore and Willis' friendship following <a href=#>their divorce in 2000</a>. Their blended family even quarantined together in 2020. But despite their tight bond, the former couple used to have a lot of issues in their marriage. For some time, both were rumored to be cheating on each other. Here's the truth about their 13-year marriage.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Alex Rodriguez Date Demi Moore?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-timeline-of-bruce-willis-amp-demi-moore-s-relationship>A Timeline Of Bruce Willis & Demi Moore's Relationship</h2><p>The two first met in July 1987 at the premiere of Stakeout starring Moore's then-fiancé, Emilio Estevez. Willis also attended the event as a guest. "My impression was, he's kind of a jerk… but Bruce was so gallant — in his own boisterous way, a real gentleman," the actress later said about their first encounter in her memoir, Inside Out.</p><p>She also recalled going to an afterparty with the Pulp Fiction star the same night. There, he asked her to write her phone number on his arm. Then as she was driving home, the actor and his entourage pulled up next to her on a highway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was a stretch limousine in the next lane, with Bruce Willis and his buddies poking up through the open sunroof, waving and shouting, 'Hey, Demi!'" she wrote. "It was like the universe was telling me: pay attention to this one." She and Estevez split shortly after.</p><p>Four months later, Moore and Willis officially started dating. They quickly got married after a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas. "We were moving to the gambling tables when Bruce said, 'I think we should get married,'" she wrote. "We'd been joking about it on the flight there, but suddenly it didn't seem like he was kidding."</p><p>A month later, they had a lavish second wedding with their famous friends in Los Angeles. Singer Little Richard was the ordained minister who married the pair. Things escalated pretty fast after that.

"When reality set in, I don't know if we really knew each other." They later welcomed two more daughters, Scout in 1991 and Tallulah in 1994. In June 1998, they announced that they were going separate ways after rumors of them splitting and cheating on each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Mila Kunis And Demi Moore's Rumored Feud</a></span></p><h2 id=did-demi-moore-cheat-on-bruce-willis>Did Demi Moore Cheat On Bruce Willis?</h2><p>Moore never addressed rumors of her cheating on Willis during their marriage.

In her memoir, the actress said that she slept with another man the night before their wedding. "The night before we got married, instead of working on my vows, I was calling a guy I'd met on a movie set. I snuck out of my own bachelorette party and went to his apartment," she wrote.</p><p>"Why did I do that? Why didn't I go and see the man I was committing to spend the rest of my life with to express my doubts? Because I couldn't face the fact that I was getting married to distract myself from grieving the death of my father," continued <a href=#>the Striptease star</a>. "Because I felt there was no room to question what I’d already put in motion. I couldn’t get out of the marriage, but I could sabotage it." The pair divorced in 1985.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her marriage to Willis, Moore was linked to Leonardo DiCaprio.

Bruce has been a good friend to me, and those rumours spoil things," explained <a href=#>the Lord of the Rings star</a>.</p><p>"Why doesn't anyone talk about how much fun he likes to have on the set, how he's always trying to give the other actors a lot of business advice? I suppose that's boring stuff, but it's better than printing lies about people just because they're actors and somehow that makes it okay."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's What Happened When Stephen Colbert Called Out Bruce Willis For Lying About Doing His Own Stunts</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmbKutYympqiqlWKvs8HCnmSwoZyhtrR5wqGcmqxdpLtuscCcn2anpJ2ys3nDrqmippdiwamxyKtkppmip7ais8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

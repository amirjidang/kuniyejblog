When Joe joined the RHONJ cast and host, Andy Cohen, at the reunion on May 3, Teresa accused him of being “a little too much involved” in the ladies’ drama during an argument about Jennifer Aydin calling Joe a “bitch boy” earlier this season. Teresa Giudice slammed her brother, Joe Gorga, for getting “too involved” in lady drama on part one of the “Real Housewives of New Jersey” Season 12 reunion. “He’s a little too much involved, that’s all I’m saying,” Giudice, 49, said, adding that she would ask her fiancé, Luis “Louie” Ruelas, to “cool it” if he took a similar approach to confronting conflict on camera. Teresa replied, “Bitch boy, I’m sorry Joe, but you’re kind of like a Housewife. Sorry, you are.” “I’m a bitch now,” he responded. “Stop it! You don’t realize what you do.” Earlier in the reunion, Teresa, Joe, and Melissa argued about Melissa not being in Teresa’s wedding to Louie, even though Joe was asked to be. “But because Melissa’s not in it, he’s not sure if he wants to be in it, which is fine,” Teresa said. “I’m sure Louie won’t get offended, I will not get offended.”&nbsp;</p><p>Everything To Know About Joe Gorga’s Sister, Teresa Giudice</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-joe-gorga-famous-for></span>What is Joe Gorga Famous For?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>Being an American television personality.&nbsp;</li><li>For starring in the TV series “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” (2010-2019).&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-joe-gorga-from></span>Where is Joe Gorga from?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Joe Gorga took birth on 21st August 1979.

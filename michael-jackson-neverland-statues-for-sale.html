This is a very unique collection of art - statues, to be exact - and they once belonged to none other than Michael Jackson himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The King of Pop was the owner of this incredible collection of statues at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Neverland Ranch</a>, and the person who has them in their possession right now is selling them as a collection.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Noble Art Lovers </a>has confirmed that individual pieces are not for sale. The cost to own<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> this sensational piece of history</a> is a cool $2.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Janet Jackson To Auction Rare Personal Treasures & Memorabilia</a></span></p><p>Michael Jackson is a legend like no other. His iconic status as a worldwide musical sensation is one of such monumental proportions that it cannot be imitated or duplicated. He is simply one of a kind. His premature death rocked the nation as fans across the globe struggled to understand how someone they admired so greatly could be torn from the world at such a young age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, a full 12 years after his death, one very lucky fan has the opportunity of a lifetime. Michael Jackson's world and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all his worldly possessions seemed so untouchable until now.</a></p><p>At this very moment, his prized collection of bronzed statues could be placed in the hands of an adoring fan... with a couple of 'catches' though. That fan will have to be an avid art collector that would appreciate the value of the items that are up for grabs, and they'll have to have<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $2.5 million dollars to spare</a>.</p><p>There are 28 treasured pieces of art for sale, each of them with their own very unique aesthetic appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, the pieces include; "numerous statues of children, including "Kids and Tree Swing," "Follow the Leader," "Young Boy and Companion," "Boy Playing Hand Bell," "The Footballer" and more. There are also many historical statues -- like "Marble Roman Bust" and "Napoleon Crossing the Alps" -- along with Cupid statues, candelabra, a wooden ship, a Marilyn Monroe statue and a Minnie Mouse figurine."</p><p>The collection is being sold by Nobel Art Lovers - a company based in Dubai. There's not much known about them other than that, and the fact that there will be no discussions about this collection being broken up and sold as individual pieces. It's a firm-no when it comes to dismantling the collection so the lucky art collector that makes this $2.5 million purchase is someone that will hopefully have lots of room, a great appreciation for really unique looking statues, and a true appreciation for the source that this came from... Michael Jackson himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFT Luxury Watch Auction Could Change The Industry Forever</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nobel Art Lovers</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6qq%2FHmpylZZqWsKy%2Fzqdkp52mmr%2Btrc2dZKyskanCpr%2BMn6arZaOWuaZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

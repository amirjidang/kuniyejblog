And that identity definitely followed her around. People wondered if <a href=#>Elle and Dakota get along</a> and whether <a href=#>Dakota or Elle makes more money</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it must be tough to be compared to a famous sibling, Elle Fanning has become popular all on her own in recent years. She stunned audiences in TV series like The Girl From Plainville and The Great. And her movies range from the tearjerker All The Bright Places to the moving drama 20th Century Women. Elle Fanning has shown her talent from a young age as she is only 25 years old.</p><p>For over four years, Elle Fanning was in a relationship with Max Minghella, known for movies like the horror film Spiral and the Aaron Sorkin-directed The Social Network. That's a really long time to be with someone, whether they are famous or not. What went wrong between the famous stars?</p><h2 id=why-did-elle-fanning-and-max-minghella-break-up>Why Did Elle Fanning And Max Minghella Break Up?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle Fanning shared that she broke up</a> with Max Minghella in an April 2023 interview with Harper's Bazaar. The publication said that she is "recently single" and that their romance ended "recently."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fanning said, "I’d love to play Grace Kelly in something. And to have kids." Fanning continued to Harper's Bazaar, "But I’m a hopeless romantic. I believe in love at first sight. Call me crazy, but I believe in those things. I feel that it’s my destiny."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/th-image-template-23.jpg><p>Elle Fanning didn't explain why she and Max Minghella split up in her Harper's Bazaar interview. And she has stayed quiet about it since. Minghella hasn't offered up a reason, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, based on Fanning's comments, it's possible that she was ready to settle down and start a family and that is why the couple decided that things wouldn't work out. It's interesting that the actress mentioned being ready to have children in her interview with Harper's Bazaar. Since her split from Minghella happened not too long ago, it seems that this topic is on her mind.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Elle Fanning's Bikini Really Said About Her Relationship With Paris Hilton</a></span></p><p>As Minghella is 37 years old and Fanning is 25, fans might wonder if they split up because there are so many years between them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/max-minghella-suit.jpg><p>According to an Us Weekly article from January 2023, the couple didn't mind that they are such different ages. A source told the publication, “The age difference isn’t an issue at all. Elle loves how mature and intelligent Max is. He’s a real intellect with a big passion for arts and culture.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source continued that people close to Fanning and Minghella wondered if they would get married in the near future. They said, “Nobody would be surprised if Max proposes soon. Elle would most likely love that too, but he’s keeping those cards close to his chest.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Close Are 'The Great' Co-Stars Elle Fanning And Nicholas Hoult In Real Life</a></span></p><p>The couple didn't share much about their romance while they were together. A Daily Mail article from May 2022 reported that they went to see HAIM perform and that this was a "rare appearance." Us Weekly reported that the actors seemed to be dating in 2018 and that Fanning starred in the movie Teen Spirit, which was the first film that Minghella directed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Fanning and Minghella didn't really talk about dating each other, it's possible to say that they are the same type of celebrity. They seem to be humble and they are always appreciative of the projects they have worked on. Even though Fanning has starred in some huge movies like Maleficent and Minghella stars in The Handmaid's Tale, they seem more content to hang out in the background than some other stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/elle-fanning-sunglasses.jpg><p>In an interview with DuJour.com, Minghella explained his regular routine, and he sounds like a totally regular person rather than someone who makes movies and TV shows for a living.</p><p>Minghella said, “Most days I work on whatever nonsense I’m involved with then I walk and get coffee. I love the familiarity of that, actually. I’m a sucker for them knowing my name and saying hi and having my order ready.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's interesting that she seems to be thinking about having children given one of her most beloved recent roles. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fanning played Catherine The Great</a> in the Hulu series The Great. <a href=#>Fanning talked about The Great</a> and shared what filming was like in several interviews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/elle-fanning-leopard-dress.jpg><p>In an interview with Awards Daily, the actress explained, "There was a sense of setting her plans in motion, because, once the baby is born, she could easily be killed. Catherine wasn’t thinking about being a mom and what’s going to be like. We always play up the truth in the comedy and the drama, and, I think, the drama can sneak up on you. It’s very bonkers and out there at times, but the stakes are actually very high. We have to play the reality of that. You can get lost in it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-elle-fanning-and-max-minghella-dating-anyone-now>Are Elle Fanning And Max Minghella Dating Anyone Now?</h2><p>Neither Elle Fanning nor Max Minghella appears to be dating anyone else since breaking up. Fanning said that she is on her own in her interview with Harper's Bazaar. And Minghella hasn't been linked to anyone new.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/max-minghella.jpg><p>If the couple did split up because their age gap proved to be too much, then it's possible that Fanning's next partner will be closer to her age. She is only 25, after all, so she might want to date someone who is also in their 20s.</p><p>At the same time, it's possible that Fanning and Minghella really didn't mind the age gap. Elle Fanning became famous at a really young age and seems very wise for 25.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Dakota And Elle Fanning’s Mom, Heather Joy Arrington</a></span></p><p>However, because Fanning made it clear that she wants to have a family, she might be looking for someone who feels the same way. Time will tell if the next person who she dates ends up being her partner for life and if they settle down.</p><p>Previously, Max Minghella was in a four-year relationship with Kate Mara that ended in August 2014. E! News reported that they had broken up a few times since they began seeing each other in 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecSlo55llpa7r7XNoGSappRiuqLEjKagp5%2BYmrmtrYybqZ6Zm2LCsXnAoJxmnJmbs6a%2BxKeanmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

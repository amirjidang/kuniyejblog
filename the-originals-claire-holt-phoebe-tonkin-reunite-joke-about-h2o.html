We were both in the Gold Coast, which is a beach town in Sydney, for years. And then, when I moved to L.A., I actually stayed on Claire’s couch when I was auditioning. And she was like, ‘This is the local coffee place.’ She really showed me the ropes of Los Angeles.”</p><p>As such, Tonkin was thrilled to reunite with the 47 Meters Down star on The Vampire Diaries and its spinoff The Originals. “When I found out I was coming on Vampire Diaries and I told her, I think she was just so excited to have a buddy in Atlanta,” she recalled. “And then, of course, when we had The Originals, it was just, like, great. Now we just both exclusively do TV shows together.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Holt, meanwhile, got nostalgic for her time on The Originals in February, posting several behind-the-scenes photos via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “Are photo dumps still a thing?” she asked her followers. “TOGS edition.” She shared pics with Tonkin, <strong>Charles Michael Davis</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Daniel Gillies</strong></a>, <strong>Riley Voelkel</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Joseph Morgan</strong></a> and more of her costars.</p><p>Voelkel, 30, and Davis, 36, each left three heart emojis in the comments section at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVivLO1xqKlmqSjYrCtrcirnGagn6HBbrzHqJybnV2pvK%2B3yKdkq52lo7a1sYyjpqSdXZavsMHTZp9rp18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The most shocking part of the video was how the A-list comedian's words were direct, intentional, and humorous in their entirety. While many fans were left with mixed feelings, the recipient was impressed and handled it pleasantly.</p><p>The Mask actor's video caused quite an uproar among social media users, but it was a reciprocation of admiration when Emma Stone replied. Jim Carrey has had <a href=#>his fair share of controversies</a>, and this was one of those moments. While he stated that he fancied her, he also acknowledged their significant age difference, but did that hinder the lovely exchange from becoming something more intense? Here's all the update after Carrey confessed his feelings to Stone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-does-emma-stone-and-jim-carrey-39-s-relationship-stand-since-his-crush-confession>Where Does Emma Stone And Jim Carrey's Relationship Stand Since His Crush Confession?</h2><p>At the time, the Dumb and Dumber actor professed his feelings for the Cruella actress, she was romantically involved with Andrew Garfield. Although Carrey's message was a funny yet affectionate one, it did not lead to a romance between both parties. It rather elicited a sweet reaction from Emma, making the confession appear as light-hearted fun between the duo.</p><p>Also, the series of events following Jim Carrey's confession to Emma Stone proved they didn't go beyond platonic. According to DailyMail, in the same week that the star actor reached out to The Help actress, she and her boyfriend, Andrew Garfield, were seen enjoying a romantic evening in Malibu. The partners looked pretty much loved-up as they dined at Nobu. Garfield and Stone's relationship was relatively new at the time, as <a href=#>they met on the set of The Amazing Spider-Man</a> in June 2011. Garfield also did not appear to be troubled or concerned after Carrey made his confession.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jim-carrey.jpg><p>On Jim Carrey's part, less than two months after putting out the eye-opening video, the Bruce Almighty actor was spotted with an unknown blonde. He appeared to have moved past his admitted infatuation with Stone as he walked out of a building in New York City in October 2011. Carrey was previously in a committed relationship with actress Jenny McCarthy. The pair dated from 2005 to 2010, and they had a son together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jim-carrey-revealed-the-truth-about-his-ex-wife-during-a-full-on-interview-with-arsenio-hall.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jim Carrey Revealed The Truth About His Ex-Wife During A Full-On Interview With Arsenio Hall">Jim Carrey Revealed The Truth About His Ex-Wife During A Full-On Interview With Arsenio Hall</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jim Carrey has rarely spoken about his first wife except the time he revealed far too much to Arsenio Hall.</p><p>Unlike Emma Stone, Jim Carrey has had scores of high-profile relationships in the Hollywood sphere. The star has also been married twice. One of his well-known romantic relationships was with Renée Zellweger, and they dated in the 2000s. They were also briefly engaged before calling it quits. However, Carrey never lost sight of how special she was to him.

The star made an up-close clip that appeared to have been filmed indoors as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he addressed Emma Stone</a>. Carrey started by stating that his message was for Stone. Per THR, he began:</p><p>"Emma, I just wanted to let you know that I think you're all the way beautiful. Not just pretty, but you know, smart and kind-hearted. And if I were a lot younger, I would marry you, and we would have chubby little freckle-faced kids."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-4-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor went on to gush about all the fun they would have together if they were a couple. He mentioned, 'We'd laugh all day long, go camping, play Yahtzee, tell ghost stories by the fire..." Jim Carrey's words turned suggestive as he mentioned, 'And the sex..." and at that point he trailed off into a dramatic pause. The Batman Forever actor continued wooing Stone by envisioning how they would spend their lives together. However, he veered off to mention how their age gap made the difference. Carrey relayed:</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jim-carrey-completely-shaded-margot-robbie-during-their-interview-on-the-graham-norton-show.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jim Carrey Completely Shaded Margot Robbie During Their Interview On The Graham Norton Show">Jim Carrey Completely Shaded Margot Robbie During Their Interview On The Graham Norton Show</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Margot Robbie had an uncomfortable smile on her face after getting a backhanded compliment from Jim Carrey on The Graham Norton Show.</p><p>"And every day for the rest of your life you would thank God that I was the appropriate age for you.

I think you are pretty special, and I wish you continued success and artistic fulfillment. Most of all, I wish you love and contentment."</p><p>Social media users did not hold back their mixed feelings about how the actor addressed the then-23-year-old actress. Many found the clip creepy as they tried to decipher if it was just for laughs. However, Emma Stone did not share the same sentiment. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She was rather flattered</a> by the admiration. The La La Land actress told New York Magazine:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was flattered, I can't even tell you.

He's amazing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jim Carrey would later clarify why he put out the video on social media. He took to Twitter (X) addressing fans and letting them know it was from a humorous angle. Carrey wrote, "Yes my msg to Emma Stone was a comedy routine and the funniest part is that everything I said is tru. People often ask me if I'm being funny or serious. The answer is YES."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jim-carrey-s-relationship-with-emma-stone-changed-after-he-awkwardly-admitted-she-was-his-crush-front-back_deposit.jpg><p>Without a doubt, Emma Stone and Jim Carrey enjoyed the moment, but years after that, the pair are leading different lives. Stone has been married to her husband, Dave McCary, since 2020. The pair met on SNL in 2016, and confirmed their relationship the following year. Stone welcomed a baby daughter with him in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqVdmK6zvsSyqmaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBixKrAx2acpqWRYsC1u82eZJygkaO0prCMmp2tnaJitaZ5wJ2koqykmrFur9GuqqFn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

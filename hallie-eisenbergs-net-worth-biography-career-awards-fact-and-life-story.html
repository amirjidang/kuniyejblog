She took herself away from the entertainment world in 2010 to attend American University in Washington, DC. She does not have a major film or television credit after 2010’s “Holy Rollers”.</p><p>Hallie Eisnberg Pepsi salary: It’s hard to say exactly how much she made from the Pepsi commercials. She wasn’t famous before the commercials so she likely had to work for a standard day rate which at the time wouldn’t have been more than $5,000 or $10,000. On the flip side, as the star of a national commercial that aired many thousands of times, she earned a royalty every time the commercial aired. She likely earned several hundred thousand dollars, potentially as much as $1 million during her time with Pepsi alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCRobmqsYyeoKydnpeys7PSZqWerF2svLPAx2aZoqeXp66xtNhmmpqqlZq%2Fbq3Wmqmdq12brqTAjJqlnWWcnrOmedKtpquxXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The rapper, 28, and the tennis star, 33, were caught on camera getting cozy while out to dinner in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sunday, Aug. 23 — and let’s just say they seem more than friendly.</p><p>Pictures <a href=#>posted by TMZ</a> on Monday appear to show the Wimbledon champ and the Degrassi alum kissing in a back room at upscale Italian eatery Sotto. According to the site, the pair hit up the downtown hot spot after Williams won the Women’s Tennis Association tournament.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Rumors about the two have been making the rounds for months. Earlier this summer, in July, Drake was spotted cheering on the athlete at Wimbledon, where she battled her way to a fourth straight majors victory.</p><p>After one match — during which Williams triumphed over Maria Sharapova — a reporter asked whether the “Started From the Bottom” hitmaker might be her “lucky mascot.” According to the Associated Press, Drake, who was at the press conference, laughed and covered his face.</p><p>“We’ve been friends for, like, so many years,” Williams replied (via the AP). “Just like family.”</p><p>Family or not, Drake has made his admiration of the superstar tennis pro very clear. While at Wimbledon, he posted a photo of Williams and her sister Venus, captioning it, “A story that will never be duplicated.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He also tweeted at her back in 2011, writing, “@serenawilliams I cannot wait to put it on you and make you sweat…….during our match this weekend.”</p><p>Drake has been linked previously with Rihanna and Tyra Banks, among others. Williams, meanwhile, was said to be dating tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadqpGgsm6%2FxKucp5ldrLatuMiapKxlk5bCqLTTZqKiq6Oeu6h5wJ%2BrnqpdnbKzedatmGaumZjBsL7YZmlpaWVngnl7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

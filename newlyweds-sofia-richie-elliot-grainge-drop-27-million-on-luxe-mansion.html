The couple – who tied the knot last month during an elaborate ceremony in France – <a href=#>recently signed the deed on a $27 million mansion</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The estate’s high price tag is explained by its luxury amenities and spaciousness. Located in Brentwood, California, the home has over 10,700 square feet of living space, including 10 bathrooms and 6 bedrooms. Elliot and Sofia officially purchased the property on May 1st, mere weeks after getting hitched.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Zolciak & Kroy Biermann Divorcing Over $1 Million IRS Debt</a></span></p><p>The couple’s real estate agent Terek Kelly, who works with The Agency, posted a TikTok giving her followers an inside look at Elliot and Sofia’s recent purchase.</p><p>In the TikTok, a variety of luxe features are visible, including a large pool, outdoor seating area with fireplace and barbecue, and skylights with geometric windowpanes. Terek said that Sofia has “classy taste” and that he can’t “wait to see how she has decorated it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sofia reportedly has an <a href=#>estimated net worth of $8 million</a> to her name, meaning the home is more than triple her estimated value. Elliot is a music executive, though his net worth is unknown. However, the newlyweds both come from wealthy families. Sofia is the daughter of music legend Lionel Richie, <a href=#>who’s reportedly worth $200 million</a>.</p><p>While Elliot’s family may not be as famous as Sofia’s, they’re in a similar industry. Elliot’s father is Lucian Grange, the Chief Executive Officer of Universal Music Group. He’s collaborated with Lionel Richie on music over the years, which is how their children became acquainted with each other.</p><p>Elliot and Sofia <a href=#>spared no expense for their recent wedding</a>. While it’s unclear exactly how much the international affair cost, it’s likely in the millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair held their wedding at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, France. One report estimates that renting out the hotel for <a href=#>the weekend would’ve cost $1.5 million</a>.</p><p>Sofia’s wedding outfits alone would’ve cost a fortune, too. The model partnered with Chanel to create multiple customs looks, including a high-neck, beaded frock for the ceremony and a shorter option for the reception.</p><p>“We created the top of that dress and made it bridal-y,” <a href=#>Sofia told Vogue of her wedding looks</a>. “It is such magic. I honestly think Elliot is going to love it. He is my biggest cheerleader when it comes to anything I wear,” Sofia continued. “If he doesn’t cry, I’ll be very sad.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Lily Collins’ $150,000 Engagement Ring & Wedding Band Stolen From Spa</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Insider</a>, <a href=#>SCMP</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmannaehxrixw6xkrKeWnq5uvsicn6KdXZq5rbXOrWSgqpGeu6ixjJ2pqKhdZ4Ruucilo6KnnmK8r3nLrq%2BeZZ2Wu7S1zqdm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

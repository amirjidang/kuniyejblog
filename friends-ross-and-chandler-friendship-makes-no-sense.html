There are a lot of things that happened between them that never really made a lot of sense. Out of the six main characters on Friends, each member has a different relationship with their surrounding circle. For example, the friendship between Joey and Phoebe is much different than the friendship between Monica and Rachel. And both of those friendships are far different from the friendship that Ross and Chandler share.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Ross and Chandler have the type of friendship that has stood the test of time since they have been friends for so many years. They have also overcome plenty of difficulties between the two of them, including having crushes on the same girl and arguing over which man is stronger. They both have found themselves attracted to members of each other’s family as well! We've noticed that there are a few things about their friendship that don’t really make sense.</p><h2 id=ross-kissed-a-girl-that-chandler-liked-in-college><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Ross Kissed A Girl That Chandler Liked In College</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/friends-8.jpg><p class=p1>It doesn’t make sense to us that Ross would kiss a girl that Chandler had a crush on! There is an unspoken code that goes between friends to prevent this sort of thing. Friends who truly care about each other wouldn’t kiss someone that their friend was attracted to or had feelings for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chandler-kissed-rachel-to-get-revenge-on-ross><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Chandler Kissed Rachel To Get Revenge On Ross</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/friends-9.jpg><p class=p1>After Ross kissed a girl that Chandler liked in college, Chandler decided to get revenge by planting a kiss on Rachel! He knew that Rachel was the object of Ross’s affection which is why he decided to do what he did.

This joke goes way too far and pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable and what isn’t. Joking about someone passing away is a little bit too serious.

It's weird that these two best friends ended up kissing each other. But... the fact that most members of the cast have kissed each other at one point or another makes this much less of a big deal.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of Monica And Chandler’s Relationship Timeline On Friends</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0edGoqqxlkaOxbq%2FHmqWdpJWneqe%2ByJ6lnauYnr1uucCknKxlnqR6tLHNrJxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The reality star says she “hysterically cried” after stepping on the ring—<a href=#>personally designed by Travis and valued at $1 million</a>—and nearly had a “nervous breakdown.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kourt told the story on Thursday’s episode of The Kardashians after momager <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris Jenner asked why the massive Lorraine Schwartz sparkler was missing from her finger</a>. As it turns out, the ring was at the jeweler getting fixed after a nasty accident.</p><p>"I was sitting on my floor folding sweatshirts and I took the ring off, and I put it next to me on the floor like thinking it would be safe right next to me," Kourtney started, before the family matriarch interjected, saying, "Get to the punchline."</p><p>"So then I had to get something up above in my closet, and when I stepped down, I stepped on the ring," she recounted. "I was like, hysterically crying in my closet for like, hours. And then I called Travis and I was like, 'I did something really, really bad.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turns out the Blink-182 drummer took the mishap in stride, and Kourt said he “handled it the best.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 8 Most Expensive And Massive Celebrity Engagement Rings Of 2022</a></span></p><p>“It really gave me, like, a nervous breakdown,” she continued. "I was like, this is the most beautiful thing that I have ever had in my life, and how could I have done that?"</p><p>Travis set the scene <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">by surrounding Kourt with roses and candles before popping the big question</a>&nbsp;on a&nbsp;beach in Montecito, California. The rocker had been romantically involved with Kourtney for less than a year —though they had been friends for years and the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan had pushed them to link up for years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It's a flawless, beautifully cut diamond stone.

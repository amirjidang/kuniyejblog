He was all the rage back then and appeared in some movies that have remained iconic to date. It all started with a truckload of commercials, but soon enough little Corey was doing big things. With a bright disposition and stellar acting skills, he could not be missed on shows like Mork & Mindy and even One Day At a Time. Even more memorable are his appearances in big pictures such as The Goonies and The Lost Boys. With all this and more in his portfolio, it is only natural to wonder what his financial situation is like. Here is what should know about Corey Feldman’s net worth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-corey-feldman-accumulate-his-net-worth></span><strong>How Did Corey Feldman Accumulate His Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Though he was off to a great start, his turbulent childhood among other things led him to lose quite a lot of money which he earned from his singing and acting career. Here’s a closer look at it all.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-beginning></span><strong>The Beginning</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The star himself was thrust into the limelight at quite a young age. Maybe being the son of a musician had something to do with it. Nevertheless, Corey Feldman was introduced into the world of acting when he was just three years old. He made his debut in an ad for McDonald’s and went on to feature in more than 100 ads after that. Additionally, he also featured in a handful of TV shows. Some of the more prominent ones are Eight Is Enough and The Bad News Bears. As great a feat as this was, it was only a launching pad into the most successful decade of his life.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-raging-80s></span><strong>The Raging 80’s</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This was when the real success kicked in; Corey Feldman found himself starring in some of the most iconic pictures out there. In fact, most of those movies are now what most people refer to as classics. He played a major support role in the movie Fountaine in Gremlins&nbsp;and even played a more memorable part in the movie, The Goonies.</p><p>Another great one was The Lost Boys, where he met a kindred spirit, Corey Haim. Theirs was a friendship that lasted till Haim’s demise in 2009. With all the fame in this decade came a lot of trouble, he had a serious battle with drugs at this point.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-anti-climatic-90s></span><strong>The Anti-climatic 90’s</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At this point, the buzz started to fizzle out and Corey Feldman was not in as many successful pictures. He did continue to act though and even went on to direct the film Busted, where Haim played the lead. It was at this point that he branched out into music with his band, Corey Feldman’s Truth Movement.</p><p>It was not a flop at all, the band has seen some great days. Altogether, they have released a total of five albums and the latest one came out in 2016.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-calm-2000s></span><strong>The Calm 2000s</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Once the new millennium clocked, Corey Feldman’s career took a turn of its own. He did not turn his back on mainstream acting as a whole. But, reality TV became more of his thing over the years. A cross-section of the shows he appeared on are Dancing on Ice, Celebrity Wife Swap,&nbsp;The Surreal Life and The Two Coreys.</p><p>All the while, he was still booking bit parts in movies while also making music. The star even got to feature in the off-Broadway production, Fatal Attraction, A Greek Tragedy. If that sounds familiar, it is because it happens to be a parody of the 1987 psychological thriller, Fatal Attraction. In the present day, he is trying to raise awareness concerning the abuse of child stars in Hollywood.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-corey-feldmans-latest-net-worth></span><strong>What Is Corey Feldman’s Latest Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Currently, the star is worth about $3 million which may not seem like much considering his portfolio. Nevertheless, he cannot be blamed for the most part of it. His parents squandered away most of his fortune which led him to seek emancipation at the age of 15. At that point, he was left with a measly $40, 000.&nbsp;Despite all this, he seems to have made peace with a lot in his life and is making the most out of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutdJmmqiqla56p7HLnaSapl2hrrWx0q1kp52kYsSwvtOhZLKdkafAbq3FrZyrZZiewG6%2BzqWcZqGeYsGpsYygpqimmZrAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

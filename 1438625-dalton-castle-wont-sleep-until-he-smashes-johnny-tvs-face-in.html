Castle is a former Ring of Honor World Champion. Recently, <a href=#>the 37-year-old star</a> has been on the hunt for former WWE Intercontinental Champion Johnny TV.</p><p><a href=#>Johnny TV</a> made his first appearance in AEW a few months ago. Since his arrival, he has been part of QT Marshall’s faction. After Marshall’s departure from the Tony Khan-based promotion, the formerly known as John Morrison has not been wrestling a lot. The last time he wrestled in a one-on-one match was on Ring of Honor Honor Club TV against Ethan Page. Although the former WWE Superstar has not been able to capture the win.</p><p>Prior to his match against Page, Johnny TV <a href=#>wrestled and lost to Dalton Castle</a>. Despite winning his match, the former Ring of Honor World Heavyweight Champion has been on the <a href=#>lookout for a rematch against Johnny TV</a>.</p><p>Recently, Dalton Castle took to Twitter to mention that he is still searching for the former WWE Superstar. Castle claimed that he would not sleep until he has smashed the face of the former WWE Intercontinental Champion.</p><p>“I used to get a sufficient amount of rest. I no longer sleep… But when John TV has a face that has been smashed, I will sleep again. I will sleep like the wind,” Dalton Castle tweeted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I used to get a sufficient amount of rest.

When he showed up, he lost to Nick Wayne. Following his loss, Castle went on to <a href=#>share his honest thoughts</a> about Wayne.</p><p>“I lost to Nick Wayne?! That’s ridiculous! I’m sorry, Lexy. I’m not yelling at you. I’m not mad at you. It’s just this whole situation. Doesn’t anybody follow the rules anymore?! Rules are rules, Lexy. It makes me so Furious. I’m just so mad. I want to punch a stranger in the face! Christian Cage came out there, right? He’s the TNT Champion? Bull crap. That guy doesn’t know drama. You want to see drama? You come to this peacock. I am the one the people crave. The viewers want to see ‘Dalton Drama Castle.’”</p><p>Castle also mentioned that the current TNT Champion Christian Cage is dull and a dumb champion.</p><p>“Christian Cage is dull, he’s dense, he’s dumb. Luchasaurus is an underdeveloped pollywog sticking his nose in other people’s business. Lucahsaurus — Lexy, put the mic in my mouth! Luchasaurus, you put your hands on my boys again, and I’m going to break your knees, you hear me?! I’m furious! I’m livid! Lexy, I mean this, I am not mad at you, but I’m livid,” Dalton Castle said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsb29qZWKxorjTqKVmm5Gowa2xjLCmp6xdqLmmsc9mrKesmaF6qbGMrKSaq5iawG62zqGlp7FdqcO0ecWamp5lmaM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

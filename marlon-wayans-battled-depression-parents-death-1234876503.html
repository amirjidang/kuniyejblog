Now I’m a man. I don’t have parents anymore, so I live differently. I understand the quality of life,” he continued. “I pray more, because when I pray I feel like I’m speaking to my parents and that they’re listening. I let them know what’s going on.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=#>The renowned comedian</a> says his mother’s passing was a breaking point in his life, as it “shattered [him] into a million pieces.” “That was my girl,” Wayans said of his family’s matriarch, whom he reveals played a contributing factor in him never asking a woman for their hand in marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1388101384.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“<a href=#>I never got married</a>, because I never wanted my mother to be jealous of a woman,” the 51-year-old revealed. “I never wanted my mother to feel second to any woman.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fortunatley, Wayans says that he’s been able to overcome his grief, in large part due to his time preparing for his upcoming comedy special, Good Grief, as he accredits that period with rescuing him from depression by “learning to laugh in [his] worst circumstances.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Good Grief will premiere on Amazon Prime Video on June 4.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1680984305.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Kus7jOp2SwmamWu7R5wZqrraSVmXqlsc%2BrnKyrmaS7brzAq5ynrKNisaat06FkampjaYV4gpRpamg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

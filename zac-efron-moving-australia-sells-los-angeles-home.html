The actor has reportedly sold his Los Angeles home for a cool $5.3 million and subsequently purchased property in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Australia</a>, where he’s planning to move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>TMZ</a> reports that Zac’s home sold for slightly under the asking price. While the star was hoping to snag $5.9 million for the mansion, he ultimately agreed to reduce the price tag by $600,000. The home, located in L.A.’s envious Los Feliz neighborhood, had been on the market since December.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Zac Efron Debuts 'Down to Earth' On July 10 On Netflix</a></span></p><p>The publication goes on to report that Zac originally purchased the property for almost $4 million in 2013. However, he did a series of renovations to the home throughout the years, which included installing a <a href=#>swimming pool</a> complete with a custom spa and waterfall. The mansion is 5,644 square feet and features 5 bedrooms and 5 ½ bathrooms. It also comes with a fitness room, camera-equipped security system, a four-vehicle garage, and a 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom guesthouse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of now, it remains unclear who purchased Zac’s former home base. But what is known is that the buyer was represented by John Fanelly of Del Rey Urban Brokerage. Zac listed his home with The Agency’s Kathrine Nichols.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Zac is trading in his L.A. lifestyle to go Down Under. The actor has reportedly purchased a 318-acre property in Tweed Valley, which is located an hour north of Byron Bay, for $2 million.</p><p>It’s been reported since last year that Zac was considering a cross-continent move. In August, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported that sources close to the actor claimed he was hoping to move to Australia and was considering putting his L.A. home on the market, which he later did do at the end of the year. The insiders claimed that Zac was over the hustle and bustle of life in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, it was widely speculated his girlfriend, Vanessa Valladares, had something to do with his desire to move. The model is born and raised in Australia, and has worked with many Australian brands, including Spell, Love St. and RVCA, <a href=#>Vogue</a> notes. The publication adds she first met Zac when she was working as a waitress at the Byron Bay General Store & Café last June. However, the pair have since broken up.</p><p>Though a reason for their split remains unconfirmed, some reports suggests that Zac didn’t feel ready to settle down and is too focused on his career. The former <a href=#>High School Musical </a>star is currently signed to a variety of projects, including a remake of the 1987 classic Three Men and a Baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 High School Musical Stars: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTHoq%2BMnp2rp55iurDCyKeeZpmlqMGzrcuimGarlaG5tHnLqKpmmZ6csq2x0mafqKWVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

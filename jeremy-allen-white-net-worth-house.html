While there are some notable examples of that process <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working</a>, the truth of the matter is that most transported series wind up becoming complete failures. Fortunately for everyone involved in the American version of Shameless, the show would become a big hit and remain on the air for many years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adapted from a British show of the same name, the American version of Shameless introduced millions of TV viewers to the Gallagher family. Unlike most television families that are sticky-sweet, the Gallaghers were a dysfunctional bunch who always seemed to get in their own way at every turn. Even though watching the Gallaghers mess up could be frustrating at times, fans of the show quickly came to love them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Shameless debuted, the series mainly focused on William H. Macy’s Frank and Emmy Rossum’s Fiona since both of those actors already were well known. Over time, however, it quickly became clear that the show’s entire cast was incredibly skilled which is why fans wanted to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">know everything</a> they could about all of them. Even within such a talented group, Jeremy Allen White quickly began to stand out. For that reason, it is fascinating to look at what White has been up to in recent years, how much money he is worth, and how he spends his cash.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How The Cast Of ‘Shameless’ Really Feels About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=catching-up-with-jeremy>Catching Up With Jeremy</h2><p>In the years since Jeremy Allen White first rose to fame when the first season of Shameless debuted in 2011, that show has continued to be his main claim to fame. Now that Shameless’ final season has wrapped up, however, it seems like White is poised to start a new era in his career. On the bright side, Emmy Rossum’s busy post-Shameless<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">schedule</a> shows that the show’s stars can go on to accomplish a lot. On top of that, White proved that he is a marvelous actor during his Shameless tenure and he was great in the 2020 thriller The Rental.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like Jeremy Allen White’s career, the actor’s personal life has undergone a lot of changes in recent years. For example, White married Addison Timlin, an actor who is best known for her time on the show Californication, in 2019. On top of that, White and Timlin welcomed their first daughter into the world in 2018 and introduced that child to her younger sister in 2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Dark Secrets The Shameless Cast Tried To Hide From Superfans</a></span></p><h2 id=jeremy-s-net-worth>Jeremy’s Net Worth</h2><p>Of course, it should go without saying that the only people who know exactly how much money a star has are the person in question and maybe a few other people in their lives. That said, there are entire teams of people who take all of the information that is publicly available about famous people and put it together to estimate their net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the case of Jeremy Allen White, the team at celebritynetworth.com estimates that he is worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$8 million</a> as of the time of this writing. Considering that White is still so young in his career, it is quite remarkable that he made so much money already. After all, it seems likely that his best years could still be in front of him too.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Did William H Macy Make As Frank Gallagher On 'Shameless'?</a></span></p><h2 id=spending-his-money>Spending His Money</h2><p>Perhaps because Jeremy Allen White rose to fame at a relatively early age, it seems very clear that he wants to maintain his privacy. For example, when it comes to most rich and famous people, an awful lot is known about how they spend their money. On the other hand, White seemingly has no interest in throwing around his cash in public. For that reason, things like where he lives and how much money he spent on his home are a complete mystery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the things that are known about how Jeremy Allen White spends his money, it seems that the actor definitely has his frugal side. After all, when it came time for White and his wife Addison Timlin to tie the knot, they didn’t spend a fortune on a huge ceremony and reception. Instead, the two actors got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married</a> at a Beverly Hills courthouse with a small group of loved ones and their friends Dakota Johnson and Chris Martin.</p><p>According to networthbro.com, however, there are certain things that Jeremy Allen White is happy to spend a pretty penny on. After all, according to them, he has an impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">luxury car collection</a>. While they don’t list the models of cars that White has bought, networthbro.com reports that he owns luxury cars produced by Ford, Mercedes Benz, and Jaguar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, as a young father, most of his money appears to be spent on his two kids and his beautiful wife.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of 'Shameless' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqqVosZurculnKdlp522tbGMp5ytZaekv7W0jKGmrquVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

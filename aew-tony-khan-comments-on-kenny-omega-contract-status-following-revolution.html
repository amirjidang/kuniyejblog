It was no surprise, as WWE has gone hard at trying to acquire Omega in the past, especially in 2018, before Omega ultimately decided to be a major part in the creation of AEW, alongside Matt and Nick Jackson, Cody Rhodes, and Tony Khan. He has been one of AEW's greats, as an AEW World Champion, Tag Team Champion, and until last night, one third of the Trios Champions. But with the CM Punk drama last year and the suspensions involved, it has many wondering if Omega really would jump ship to WWE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following AEW's Revolution pay-per-view, President Tony Khan spoke a bit about Omega's contract status at the media scrum. "I think Kenny Omega is one of the best wrestlers in AEW history. He’s one of the most decorated wrestlers. To have somebody who’s been World Trios Champion and had a great match defending that title tonight. World Tag Team Champion and the World Champion. He’s done everything you can do as a World Champion in this company, and also the IWGP US Champion, and this year alone, he’s had some of the best matches in the world. I thought it was an excellent match on the pay-per-view tonight. He started the year with a great match versus Will Osprey at [NJPW] Wrestle Kingdom. Kenny Omega can do anything he sets his mind to. He’s one of the best stars in the world, and I hope he’s here for a very long time.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrestlingnews.co</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>AEW Reportedly Tacks On Time To Kenny Omega's Current Contract</a></span></p><h2 id=what-will-kenny-omega-do-when-his-aew-contract-expires>What Will Kenny Omega Do When His AEW Contract Expires</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kenny-omega-dynamite.jpg><p>While Kenny Omega leaving AEW seems far fetched, it's not impossible. Who, for example, really thought that Cody Rhodes would leave AEW to go back to WWE? Kenny Omega has a comfortable home in AEW where he will always remain perhaps their most loved star. There have also been reports, however, that <a href=#>Omega is open-minded about going to WWE</a>. Will the temptation of the challenge of WWE and dream matches against the likes of Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, and The New Day lure him away from the AEW home he helped create? It seems that even Tony Khan doesn't know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeRmsRuwM6nsGajmJa7bq%2FOpqSepqSoerC6jKScp6apYryuscaaZJynnqm%2Foq%2FTZqqtmaSqwG6yzqWjqK%2BZo7RuvsSvpqWtpJ68r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

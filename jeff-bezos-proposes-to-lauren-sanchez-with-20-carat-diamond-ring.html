Since then, Lauren’s massive ring has been photographed on multiple occasions, proving she said ‘yes’ to the billionaire.</p><p><a href=#>Speaking to Page Six</a>, one jeweler estimates that Lauren’s new ring is at least 20 carats.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bre Tiesi Claims Nick Cannon Has Too Many Kids To Pay Child Support</a></span></p><p>The couple were reportedly lovey-dovey after making a recent stop, onlookers say. “They were all over each other. I mean, they’re always affectionate, but they could not keep their hands off each other,” a witness told Page Six.</p><p>“They were telling everyone they were engaged, they were so excited, they are completely in love,” they continued.</p><p>It’s yet to be confirmed how much Lauren’s ring cost as well as when (and where) the couple plan to tie the knot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This will be Jeff’s second trip down the aisle. The businessman ended a long-time marriage when he finalized his divorce from MacKenzie Scott in 2019. They were married for nearly two decades after tying the knot in 1993. They welcomed 4 kids during their relationship.</p><p>When Jeff and MacKenzie divorced in 2019, she walked away with $35.6 billion in Amazon stock, making her the 3rd richest woman and 22nd wealthiest person in the world. However, MacKenzie has liquidated much of her wealth in the years since their split by donating to various charities.</p><p><a href=#>The novelist had already been through a second marriage</a> since her divorce from Bezos. MacKenzie wed Dan Jewett, a high school teacher from Seattle, in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple announce their marriage via Giving Pledge’s website, an organization that encourages billionaires to donate their wealth, which MacKenzie works closely with. Their statement echoed Dan’s support for her commitment to charitable work.</p><p>“I am married to one of the most generous and kind people I know — and joining her in a commitment to pass on an enormous financial wealth to serve others,” he said.</p><p>However, the pair announced their split only a year after getting married.</p><p><a href=#>MacKenzie and Dan reportedly signed a prenup</a> before tying the knot, so there was no dispute over her fortune when they split. The divorce was finalized quickly.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Beyonce & Jay-Z Drop $200 Million On California’s Most Expensive Home</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8menZ9lkprHsL%2BMqamoqJ%2BosrR506hkpZmlp7KvedKapZygla96uLXToWRraF2YrrOt02abopmdpLuledGipaBn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

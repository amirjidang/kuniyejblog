There were reportedly over 30 people at the event, and police state that at least two weapons were fired after a disagreement over a dice game ensued; <i>The Last Rocket</i> rapper was not a participant in the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He was an innocent bystander,” Sgt. Michael Burrow of the Houston Police stated. Chief Finner echoed the sentiment, stating the “Casper” rapper was simply in the “wrong place at the wrong time.” Houston police used surveillance and cell phone footage plus physical evidence to determine that Clark was the shooter.</p><p>According to <a href=#><i>Vibe</i></a>, Takeoff was funeralized on Friday (Nov. 11) and was remembered by Drake, Justin Bieber, Chloe Bailey, Yolanda Adams, his entire Quality Control family, and more in attendance.

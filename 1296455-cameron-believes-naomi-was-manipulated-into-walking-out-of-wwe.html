Her former tag team partner Ariane Andrew&nbsp;seems to think so.</p><p>Ariane Andrew (aka Cameron) sat down this week with <a href=#>Steve Fall of </a><a href=#>SEScoops</a> to discuss what went down with Naomi and <a href=#>Sasha Banks</a> Monday night at WWE RAW. When asked how she thinks something like this went down, Andrew says she believes that Naomi was manipulated by someone into walking out on the company Monday night.</p><p>“What happened I think — I’m just gonna remove Sasha because Sasha’s done this before. Sasha’s a great athlete, let me not get this twisted cause I don’t want fans coming for me. She’s definitely deserved — like she’s a great wrestler, she’s a great character, she does what she has to do,” Andrew said. “My girl Naomi, she wouldn’t do this and I feel like she wouldn’t do this unless she had someone manipulating and telling her how to do this. Let’s best believe if I was here, coming as a Funkadactyl we wouldn’t have this happening at all.”</p><p>“Again, Sasha is Sasha. You have Snoop Dogg as your cousin. You’re a top athlete, you can do whatever the f*ck you wanna do,” Cameron said. “You can literally say what you wanna say, do what you wanna do with no repercussion.&nbsp;And if you’re a star athlete, I feel like she can back it up. The one thing that she can do is she can back it up. It’s not like, ‘oh she can have all these people who can back her up without having the talent to do so or the beauty.’&nbsp;She’s a f*cking top f*cking b*tch, she can f*cking back it up in the ring but if you have the top agent, you have a top celebrity backing you up, a thousand percent you’re gonna have the extra boost.&nbsp;But someone like Naomi, where’s your extra boost?”</p><p>With the future of the WWE Women’s Tag Team Titles currently up in the air, Cameron made an offer to return to the company to team with her former Funkadactyl tag team partner.</p><p>“This is where we’re at, so it’s unfortunate what happened but I’m gonna say it right here: Naomi, I’ve always been your girl, I’ve always been by your side. Do you need a tag team partner to come help you out?&nbsp;Cause I’m here because I got you and we ain’t gonna do this foolishness,” Cameron said. “We can still make a dream team happen, we can make history happen, and we ain’t gotta do all this stuff. Just play the game, girl. I’ll play it with you.”</p><p>What do you make of Cameron’s comments?

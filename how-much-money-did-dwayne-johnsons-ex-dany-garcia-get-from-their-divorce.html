It should not come as a surprise to reveal that things were extremely amicable during the negotiations.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-and-dany-garcia-ended-things-on-amicable-terms>Dwayne Johnson And Dany Garcia Ended Things On Amicable Terms</h2><p>Hollywood's breakups usually don't end very well, especially when it comes to the financial settlements. However, the exact opposite held true for both Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia. Although it did play an emotional toll on the two, they agreed to stay amicable throughout the entire process. Garcia explained the healthy process alongside Marie Claire.</p><p>"Some people go through separation and there's no conversation, and it's a dark time, and one person goes off, but that was never us. We went on this journey together."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>What Does Dwayne Johnson's Wife Lauren Hashian Do For A Living?</a></span></p><p>"We were going to change the manner of the relationship together. We spoke every day, and multiple times a day—not only on business, but on what was happening personally. We spent over a year looking at the things that didn't work in our marriage, the reasons why, making sure those elements had been cleared and taken care of, and that we had a real understanding of respect."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We gave ourselves room to know that there may be emotional freak-outs as new people come into our lives. We were like, 'Okay, we're human, so we're going to work through that.' But if you have this agreement that no one is going to leave the table, suddenly you can tackle everything."</p><p>Not only was the split amicable behind the scenes but the settlement was also done fairly.</p><h2 id=dany-garcia-didn-t-need-dwayne-johnson-s-money-and-settled-for-monthly-child-support-payments>Dany Garcia Didn't Need Dwayne Johnson's Money And Settled For Monthly Child Support Payments</h2><p>Reported by TMZ back in 2008, the headline explained the details of the divorce. According to the release, <a href=#>Dany Garcia had no interest in taking DJ's money</a> - she already had quite the worth declaring $700K for the year as a financial advisor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, a trust fund was set up for the couple's daughter Simone, to which both contributed equally to per month, putting in $5,000 each. The money went towards school and other living expenses.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson's Team Stopped Him From Answering This Question During An Interview</a></span></p><p>The only main difference was DJ paying for child support, which came out to $22,454 per month. The shared custody battle was done in the correct manner and in addition, it would set up a new relationship between Dwayne and Dany, this time working as business partners.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-ended-up-hiring-his-ex-wife-and-she-changed-his-career>Dwayne Johnson Ended Up Hiring His Ex-Wife And She Changed His Career</h2><p>Not only was the settlement a positive one but the former couple would also start a working relationship. DJ wasn't happy with the direction of his career, being asked to drop weight and avoid so many things he loved. Garcia interjected and took over Johnson's career. She explained the process, "We knew that we were moving into that period of our lives, the closing of a personal relationship. I was already deeply involved with his agents, I was already commenting on scripts. It was a very natural conversation, where he just said to me, 'I would love for you to do this full-time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Garcia took a completely different approach to DJ's former agents, wanting Hollywood to work for him and his look, not the other way around.</p><p>"So Dwayne and I had a conversation. He had lost a lot of weight to fit certain parts, and he said, 'I can't do this anymore. I need to be me.' I supported him and said, 'Let's do you. That's all we need to do. Let's make Hollywood make room for you.'"</p><p>As they say, the rest is history and DJ would become the biggest star in all of Hollywood. The successful partnership continues on, with the duo recently buying an entire football league, the XFL. The two will continue to enjoy success side by side for years to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson And Dany Garcia Prove They Didn’t Just Buy The XFL For Show</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxqrCMna6asZ6aequ7x6eqqKajYrK5ecOapbJll5a%2FpLXAZp6erF2bv7C5jK2fnqGiYrGqws6rmp5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

For Van Dyke, that didn’t matter. He recalled meeting Silver, 52, during <a href=# rel=noopener>a recent interview</a> with Entertainment Tonight’s <strong>Kevin Frazier</strong>.</p><p>“I never approached a strange woman in my life,” he said. “And she walked by and I jumped and I said, ‘Hi, I’m Dick.’ I had no idea she was half my age. Beautiful.”</p><p>Silver was a makeup artist, and the actor used that as a reason to get her business card.</p><p>“She had one card left, which I took and hired her,” he said.</p><p>What started as a friendship eventually became more, and as the two bonded, Silver said, their romance began to seem more natural.</p><p>“We were friends for so long that when I told people that I know, they were happy about [our relationship], and I was scared,” Silver said. “I mean, the facts, our age difference. But it’s so irrelevant. I think when you see us together, it’s like you don’t think about it.”</p><p>Van Dyke jumped in, adding, “I was fortunate that I didn’t grow up.”</p><p><a href=#>The Mary Poppins star</a>’s acting career has spanned more than 70 years as he became known as a comedian, singer and dancer. His self-titled sitcom, The Dick Van Dyke Show, ran from 1961 to 1966, concluding 13 years before Silver was born.</p><p>Silver says Van Dyke taught her the joys he had shared with TV and movie audiences for decades.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve never met anyone like him,” she said. “He’s always happy and just positive. Always singing, and I would never sing in public. He got me to sing. He got me to sing up on a stage and sang in front of 1,500 people for the first time. He’s just the most joyful person. He influences everybody else to be more joyful, playful.”</p><p>Even at his age, Van Dyke isn’t ready to slow down. He credited <a href=#>exercise</a> for helping to keep him going.</p><p>“I’ve often tried to think what did I do to live this long and I can’t figure out,” he said. “The only thing is I’ve always exercised. We still go to the gym three days a week and work out. And I believe that’s the secret. Most people at 98 years old don’t really feel like working out and they seize up, you know?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadoZOgeretzWabsqOVqHq4tcWeZJqqnJq7pnnSmrCsZWRrerqxwKtkmp%2BVYrSivIyiqmahoqeyrbHVmqWtZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

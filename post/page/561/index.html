<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2024-08-05>August 05, 2024</time></span></div><section class=summary>Back with a vengeance! Gisele Bündchen has graced her first magazine cover since her divorce from Tom Brady.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The supermodel, 42, looked fierce — and nearly unrecognizable —&nbsp;on Vogue Italia’s March 2023 issue, which hits newsstands on February 28.

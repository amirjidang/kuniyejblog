It only makes perfect sense, they come from parents whose names sound the same. Well, 29-year-old Blac Chyna’s daughter, Dream, will have an incredibly interesting upbringing to say the least being born from such stock as Blac Chyna, aka Angela Renée White and 31-year-old Rob Kardashian. Having a former dancer for a mother and a reality TV star dad can really bring a lot of excitement into a child’s life and we can only imagine what baby Dream’s life has in store for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What we do know is that part of the time Dream will be raised alongside her 5-year-old brother, King Cairo Stevenson, from another daddy, Tyga. We also know that there is some seriously convoluted stuff going on with Blac Chyna’s extended family that would make most of our heads spin. The kids could actually branch off and start their own reality TV series ‘<i>Keeping Up With Our Relatives</i>’, which might prove near impossible.</p><p>With the abundant cast of characters involved in Dream’s little life, it is anyone's guess what she will turn out like, but we do have a good idea of what her mom will and will not allow in her life. Let’s take a look now at things Dream will never be able to do because of Blac Chyna and surprisingly it's not all bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-will-never-get-her-first-christmas-back>She Will Never Get Her First Christmas Back</h2><p>Arriving just in time for the holidays, there were such high hopes for Dream to have her best first Christmas ever. The proud parents even set up an Instagram account for Dream and eagerly shared every part of her new little life with her adoring fans. A video was posted of sweet Dream rocking out to ‘<i>Santa Baby,</i>’ wearing, of course, a pair of Santa Baby red socks and a cute little white dress.</p><p>Sadly, twas a few nights before Christmas and mommy and daddy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">headed to splitsville</a> instead of Whoville. Rob posted a very sad Snapchat video of an empty baby nursery and made several statements like, "So I get home and Chyna took the baby, took the whole nursery we built," and "Chyna took everything that we built for the nursery for the baby Dream and she left, and she just left me alone and took the baby."</p><h2 id=she-won-t-be-the-center-of-blac-chyna-s-universe>She Won’t Be The Center Of Blac Chyna’s Universe</h2><p>Mentally strong parents will never make their child the center of their universe, and Blac Chyna certainly is a mentally strong person. She has stated on several occasions that she was ‘Blac Chyna’ long before Rob came along and now that Dream is in her life that probably won’t change things. Let’s not forget, she already has another child with baby daddy Tyga and that did not change her so why would Dream?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blac Chyna has proven to be an extremely resourceful individual and having kids will probably not derail her ambition to be successful. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2013 she enrolled herself in a professional makeup artist school </a>and launched her very own adhesive eyelash brand called Lashed by Blac Chyna. Then in 2014, she opened a full-service beauty bar on Ventura Blvd. in LA. where she does it all, including offering makeup courses.</p><h2 id=she-probably-won-t-get-to-spend-much-time-with-auntie-kim-k>She Probably Won’t Get To Spend Much Time With Auntie Kim K</h2><p>It is not rocket science to figure out Blac Chyna will most likely not want her daughter spending any quality time with someone who she thinks torpedoed her reality TV show. The moment<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Blac Chyna filed a lawsuit</a> against Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner for putting the kibosh on her reality TV show "<i>Rob & Chyna</i>" I am pretty sure she realized that would make an uncomfortable situation for all parties involved to ever gracefully socialize together again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The judge hearing the case in January 2018 really dropped the bomb on Blac Chyna when he tentatively agreed to dismiss Kim and Kris completely from her lawsuit. He disagreed with Blac Chyna’s claim that E! would not do the show because the Kardashians portrayed her as a “bad mother”. He pointed out that Blac Chyna did not have an enforceable contract with the network and Season 2 was put on hold due to the pair's breakup. The lesson here BC - If it's not in writing, it doesn't exist!</p><h2 id=she-might-not-spend-much-time-with-gramma-kris-either>She&nbsp;Might Not&nbsp;Spend Much Time With Gramma Kris Either</h2><p>When grandma has the audacity to bribe both parties involved with significant cash amounts to keep them apart, that’s not a good thing for Dream. The 62-year old momager, Kris Jenner put her money where her mouth was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and offered bribes to both Blac Chyna</a> and her son Rob. For Blac Chyna, it was $5 million dollars to just “walk away” from Rob and their baby daughter. For Rob, it was even before Dream was born. Kris offered Rob $6 million dollars to start up another business if he would just leave his baby mama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now we know there were bumps in their relationship all along, but It appears that Kris would rather see her son happy without them and pay child support for 18 years rather than have Blac Chyna and Dream in his life. With all of this, you can be pretty certain Blac Chyna will not want Grandma spending much time with Dream. Who only knows what kind of bribes Grandma will offer Dream?</p><h2 id=she-will-find-it-difficult-to-follow-her-family-tree>She Will Find It Difficult To Follow Her Family Tree</h2><p>Ok, so here is one of the most convoluted family trees ever and it will require a lot of concentration on your part. Here goes so try not to get lost in translation. Michael Ray Stevenson, aka Tyga, which is an acronym for Thank you God always is a rapper that ‘hooked up’ with Blac Chyna. They spawned a child named King Cairo Stevenson. Now King Cairo is the half-brother of Dream. Dream’s daddy, Rob Kardashian, has a half-sister, Kylie Jenner and she ‘hooked up’ or ‘linked up’, whatever you want to call it nowadays, with Tyga after he and Chyna split. For a while, it was rumored that Kylie’s baby Stormi was, in fact, Tyga’s and that really would have been weird. Fortunately, it turned out not to be&nbsp;the case but if it were Stormi would be half-cousins with Dream. Rob would be King Cairo’s stepdad and Blac Chyna would be the aunt to King’s half-sibling, Stormi. Whew!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-won-t-be-able-to-unsee-her-mother-s-interesting-life-moments>She Won’t Be Able To Unsee Her Mother’s&nbsp;Interesting Life Moments</h2><p>Well, where should we start here? Blac Chyna’s best friend these days should really be Google Alert and not Amber Rose. She just recently had a tape leaked and that is only one small piece of a large puzzle. Lisa Bloom, Blac Chyna’s lawyer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stated in a tweet</a> that ”posting explicit images without the consent of everyone in those images -- is a crime, a civil wrong, and a form of domestic abuse.” Maybe just not taking a video or suggestive pictures of yourself might be the simple answer, but in today's day of smartphones, I guess it makes the phones smarter than us. Also, many online images of Blac Chyna are a little out there, and like most kids, Dream will probably&nbsp;feel&nbsp;a bit embarrassed by both her mom and dad when she grows up.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-won-t-have-a-two-biological-parent-household-upbringing>She Won’t Have A Two Biological Parent Household Upbringing</h2><p>At only a year and a half old Dream Renee Kardashian already has some life experiences that have been extremely unusual to say the very least. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It is common knowledge that Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian have a volatile relationship</a> and just that alone can have severe ramifications for allowing baby Dream to have a stable upbringing. With the negativity surrounding her parents and their constant bashing of each other, how could it ever be possible for her to have a normal upbringing? It is not likely that Blac Chyna and Rob will mend fences and get married and live happily ever after, so Dream will not be raised with both her biological parents in one household. When you have such media attention on each of your parents there is no way life could ever be what most of us would consider normal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-already-making-her-own-money>She&nbsp;Is Already Making Her Own Money</h2><p>Sadly before she was even one month old, baby Dream was already placed into the workforce by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">modelling her daddy’s designer sock line</a>. Yep, daddy Dashian even posted an Instagram video of his little princess wearing the socks with the caption "@dream loves her new @arthurgeorge87 SANTA BABY kids socks!! From ShopArthurGeorge.com." Wow Rob, way to exploit your baby girl, shameless! Another modelling gig for Dream was right at birth, talk about getting a head start. Dream was welcomed into the world with not one, but two pairs of $130 Yeezy Boost 350 Sneakers. Now, these are not just any sneakers, these are sneakers designed by her uncle Kanye. The funny thing here is that Kanye said, “I don’t want the price to be $350. I don’t want to play this sneaker culture game where people be reselling them for high prices.” Sure Kanye!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-will-always-have-a-unique-sense-of-fashion>She Will&nbsp;Always Have A Unique Sense Of Fashion</h2><p>How could Dream possibly ever have a normal sense of fashion when your mother is Blac Chyna? At Dream’s second first birthday party (yes, daddy gave her the first, first birthday party) Blac Chyna put her baby through several clothing changes. Since it was a mermaid themed party, it was only fitting that Dream wore a mermaid tail of iridescent blue and a shell bikini top in hot pink which her mom shared in an Instagram pic. At one point she even donned a Givenchy Tee and a tutu made of pink tulle with a matching hat. Recently Dream was seen hanging out with mom poolside and she was wearing a tasseled white bikini and a wide-brimmed hat. I wonder if baby Dream has her own walk-in closet?</p><h2 id=she-will-never-have-blac-chyna-s-last-name>She Will Never Have Blac Chyna’s Last Name</h2><p>Kind of like Cher and Madonna, do we really even remember Blac Chyna’s real last name? With a true Kardashian for a father, Dream is the only recent baby with the Kardashian last name. That will probably open lots of doors for her in the future and the present as well. The Kardashian’s have always felt the money was Blac Chyna’s motive for having the baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ reported </a>that Rob was being fronted money from his family to pay child support to Blac Chyna in the amount of $20 thousand a month. Even though some of that money was going directly to the nannies, BC is still making some serious bank. Those $20k months of child support may be numbered though. Rob is broke, his designer socks are barely turning a profit and his reality show days are done so he can always ask the court to modify the support.</p><h2 id=she-will-never-be-kept-away-from-her-daddy>She Will Never Be Kept Away From Her Daddy</h2><p>Even though it did not end well for Chyna and Rob and she may not want him in her life anymore, that doesn’t mean she wants to keep Dream out of his life. She did make a vow to “never” request from a judge an order to keep the reality TV star away from their daughter, but that did not mean she would never ask a judge to keep Rob away from her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was granted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a temporary restraining order in 2017 </a>against her former fiancé, for posting some compromising pictures of her on the internet. The restraining order terms prohibited Rob from cyberbullying her by not posting any videos, pictures or making personal comments about her. Despite all of that, they have made co-parenting Dream a priority and have an unofficial agreement where they equally share physical custody of her. I guess at least in that way you could call them the Dream team.</p><h2 id=she-will-always-have-a-unique-family-dynamic>She Will&nbsp;Always Have A Unique Family Dynamic&nbsp;</h2><p>Since Dream is being raised by her mom half the time and is living with her half-brother, King Cairo, it is only natural that she will be exposed to some of the bad habits King has reportedly picked up. King Cairo’s baby daddy, Tyga, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed to Hollywood Today Live </a>his son has picked up the bad habit of cursing and it comes from King hanging out in his daddy’s studio, listening to his music. The rapper recounted, “He actually, he had an incident at school, they called me and they were like, 'Your son's walking around saying the B-word. And I was like, 'Where did he hear that?' He told them, 'My dad says it in the studio.'' You can’t just only blame Tyga for the bad language because Blac Chyna has a tattoo that&nbsp;reads the F-bomb word and it will probably pose a problem when Dream is old enough to read. Wow, I simply have no words, but would love to hear Blac Chyna’s explanation as to why.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-will-never-be-able-to-unsee-her-mom-s-tattoos>She Will Never Be Able To Unsee Her Mom’s Tattoos</h2><p>Blac Chyna's body is literally covered in tatts from top to bottom! From her hands and arms to her legs, feet and torso she is inked up all over. She has at least sixteen known tattoos, and one of them is&nbsp;an expletive under her armpit. She has an array of images of flowers, butterflies, watermelons and lilies, to words like her kid's names and the f-word.</p><p>When Dream gets old enough to realize what a tattoo is and with exposure to her mom’s tatts, she will probably think it is a very normal situation to have so many of them. Hopefully, for Dream’s sake, she will take after her Auntie Kim who does not have a single tattoo. Kim has been vocal against tattoos and was quoted as saying to her sister Khloé before she got one, "You don't put a bumper sticker on a Bentley." I guess that makes Blac Chyna a&nbsp;Nissan Versa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-won-t-receive-the-kardashian-backlash>She Won’t Receive The Kardashian Backlash</h2><p>Let’s remember one very important thing here and it is that Dream has the Kardashian last name. It is well known that Blac Chyna is family feuding with many members of the Kardashian family, but baby Dream is blood and the Kardashian’s will keep their Blac bashing to a minimum amount for her sake.</p><p>Auntie KK has taken the high road by refusing to publicly bash her niece's mother. When she appeared on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Jimmy Kimmel Live </i></a>show and was asked about Blac Chyna by Jennifer Lawrence, the guest host and super fan of the Kardashian’s, Kim stated, ”I always said when someone was going to ask me, you know, Dream is going to see this one day, so I think it’s just super respectful to not say anything about my niece’s mom.” Way to show some class, Kim!</p><h2 id=she-might-not-be-as-close-to-her-kardashian-cousins>She&nbsp;Might Not&nbsp;Be As Close To Her Kardashian Cousins</h2><p>With all the lawsuits and life battles Blac Chyna is bombarding the Kardashian’s with, it is not surprising that Dream will probably be a bit left out of all the family get-togethers and functions. Even though custody is split 50/50 between Blac Chyna and Rob, that still means that half of her time will be spent away from her dad’s family and all of her cousins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We all know the Kardashian’s are pretty close with each other so it’s only natural that Kim’s three children North West, Saint West and Chicago West will spend time with their cousins Mason Dash Disick, Penelope Scotland Disick and Reign Aston Disick who are Kourtney’s kids. Since they will grow up together spending lots of time with each other, Dream will be left out of the picture half of the time, and when she does spend time with them, she will be the odd ball out.</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thesun.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allure.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bravotv.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hollywoodlife.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dailymail.co.uk</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people.com&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLBqbXNoKpmnKKarq55zKKeoaxdo7K3sdFmmZ5lkZe5pnnTqGSdp12XsqSt1KycZqeWYq%2BtrcJmmqGxnpZ8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

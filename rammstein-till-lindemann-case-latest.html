He is the band Rammstein’s primary vocalist.</p><p>Although Till Lindemann was raised in the East German town of Wendisch-Rambow, close to Schwerin, he was born in Leipzig.</p><p>His mother, Brigitte “Gitta” Hildegard Lindemann, worked as a journalist and writer before retiring.</p><p>Werner Lindemann was a well-known children’s poet. Sophia Thomalla and Till were a couple.</p><p>In addition to playing one song with the punk band Feeling B (which was the previous band of Rammstein members Paul H. Landers, Christoph “Doom” Schneider, and Christian “Flake” Lorenz), Lindemann began playing drums for First Arsch, who published an album titled Saddle Up.</p><p>Lyric writing for Lindemann started in the 1990s. The group won a Berlin competition in 1994, allowing them to hire a studio to produce a four-track demo. The following year saw the founding of Rammstein.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sexual Harassment on Three Counts</h2><p>As fresh charges of sexual misbehavior have surfaced, Till Lindemann, the main vocalist of the German rock band Rammstein, has been dumped by his book publisher.</p><p>Following an incident at the band’s most recent concert in Vilnius, Lithuania, where a woman from Ireland allegedly claimed Lindemann drugged her drink, the claims first surfaced.&nbsp;</p><p>Shelby Lynn claimed that after turning down the 60-year-old’s advances earlier in the evening, she awoke the next morning at her hotel with injuries she couldn’t place.</p><p>But since then, more claims have been made against the vocalist, with the German news source Tagesschau publishing numerous accounts of sexual assault.&nbsp;</p><p>Lindemann requested women to join him in a private room before allegedly forcing her to have sex with him.&nbsp;</p><p>This happened in February 2020.&nbsp; She was 22 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Another woman was 21 years old at the time of the alleged occurrence. Reporters also interviewed her. She stated that Lindemann was on top of her when she woke in a hotel room. She continued alleging that Lindemann’s agents later offered her medication, which she allegedly declined.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened in Vilnius Concert?</h2><p>Shelby Lynn, an Irish lady, claims that Lindemann or a member of Rammstein’s staff or entourage poisoned her drink after she was invited to an after-concert party backstage in Vilnius.</p><p>After consuming a drink offered by Lindemann, she claimed she started forgetting things and later woke up in her hotel room with bruises she didn’t remember obtaining. Additionally, Lynn asserted that she had turned down Lindemann’s attempt to kiss her earlier in the evening, to which she claimed he reacted furiously.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are other Allegations about Till Lindemann?</h2><p>Following Lynn’s allegations, many women approached Tagesschau with their own <a href=#>stories</a> about their interaction with the rock star; two women claimed to have experienced sexual assault.</p><p>One lady, identified by Taggeschau as Cynthia A, stated that Lindemann made her have sex with him when she was 22. “At that time, all I could think was, Oh my God, that hurts. Hopefully, it will be over soon,” she told the news organization.</p><p>Cynthia A claimed that although she did not expressly say no, it was obvious that she was quite uncomfortable. She went on to say that Lindemann “must have noticed that it wasn’t easy to sleep with me.”</p><p>Taggeschau claimed that speaking with several of the woman’s friends—whom she told about what occurred—substantiated the charges. The incident allegedly occurred in February 2020 and is now referred to by Cynthia A as an “assault and abuse of power.”</p><p>Another lady asserted that Lindemann was sleeping on top of her when she was 21 years old when she awoke in a hotel room during a post-show party. When Lindemann asked her whether she wanted him to stop, “Kaya R” allegedly said she “didn’t even know what he wanted to stop doing.”</p><p>Women claimed they were “specifically approached” by members of Lindemann’s “environment” either via social media or at the concerts themselves, according to Taggeschau, who also claimed that the interviews they had conducted had revealed a “process” by which Lindemann’s team selected them for after-show parties and backstage encounters.</p><p>The news source stated that “this is what happened in various cities throughout Europe, always with a very similar process,” adding that women who were contacted before events were instructed, “to dress attractively.”</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2BwKakrKyVnrtuwMilo2akmaOxprnAp6Vmm5Gosm64wK2crKxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

In 2019, Beck was a midfielder for the Portland Pilots men's soccer team Noah Beck has instead kickstarted a highly successful social media career. Probably best known for his popular videos on TikTok — where the 21-year-old Arizona native’s shirtless dances and humorous skits went viral while he was quarantining during the pandemic — Beck now has upwards of 34 million followers on that platform, plus millions more on Instagram and YouTube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Inside Tyler, The Creator’s $7.9 Million Mid-Century Modern Bel Air Home</b></a></span></p><p>Fast-forward to today, and he’s also managed to parlay his rising fame into numerous other arenas — he snagged a coveted front-row seat at Paris Fashion Week, attended the Cannes premiere of “Top Gun: Maverick,” modeled for AMI Paris and played in a celebrity soccer match for UNICEF. To top it all off, the aspiring actor signed with Creative Artists Agency at the beginning of the year, and not only will star in but produce a feature film — “The QB Bad Boy and Me” — set for release in January 2023.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the rising superstar also has departed the Sherman Oaks rental house he shared with three other social media creators to go out on his own for the first time ever. With an estimated net worth of around $5 million, he used a portion of his earnings to pick up a townhouse-style unit in an intimate West Hollywood condominium complex built back in the late 1980s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Records show Beck doled out nearly $1.7 million for his new digs, which feature three bedrooms and four baths in just over 2,100 square feet of two-level living space boasting dark hardwood floors and tray ceilings throughout. Several balconies overlook city lights views, according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i>.</a></p><p>Among the main-level highlights upon entry is a powder blue-hued living room hosting a fireplace and wall of built-in bookshelves. In the rear of the home, a spacious living/dining room area sports sliding glass doors leading out to one of the aforementioned balconies, as well as an updated kitchen outfitted with marble countertops, a breakfast counter and high-end stainless Viking appliances. A wet bar is neatly tucked into a nook around the corner.</p><p>Upstairs, a trio of ensuite bedrooms include a master retreat complete with a sitting area, access to yet another balcony and a spa-like bath equipped with a steam shower. Rounding it all out: three parking spots in a garage with controlled-access entry and a gym on the property.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmatoZupvKx5yKedpa2Vo7CmvoynppqgXZeypLeMm6yyq12ssrTAjKGmpaSprLywsIysq5qqpJq%2FbrzAnWSfp6Jifm6DjKagpaSZpLtw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

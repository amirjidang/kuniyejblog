"This past year with COVID has accelerated so many things. As someone who traveled constantly, I had a chance to stay home and re-evaluate what was important to me,” she said to the publication.

"I have gotten the unique opportunity to get to know the real Paris on a daily basis just the two of us during these past 15 months and I couldn't be more excited and lucky to have her as my future wife and partner," Reum explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The news of their engagement broke on February 17th – Paris’ birthday. The socialite turned 40-years-old this year.

After she said ‘Yes,’ the newly engaged pair posed for a series of photographs at their engagement sight alongside close family. Hilton’s younger sister, Nikki Hilton, is present in some of the photos as well as Reum’s brother. But perhaps the start of the shoot was Hilton’s stunning dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The publication explains Hilton wore a white, sparkling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrofete dress</a> and matching crown made by designer <a href=#>Loschy</a>. The gorgeous dress is still available in some sizes on Retrofete’s website, costing buyers a cool $985. It’s described as a “meticulously embellished, maxi-length design” featuring an invisible back/zip closure. It’s only available in silver and white.</p><p>As for Hilton’s engagement ring, it’s just as glamorous as her outfit. Vogue explains the emerald cut diamond ring was specially designed by Jean Dousset, who happens to be the great-great-grandson of Louis Cartier. Dousset named the ring ‘Paris’ after her. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video posted to Hilton’s YouTube</a> channel earlier today outlines the effort that went into designing the mesmerizing, hand-painted ring. While the exact cost of the ring is unknown, <a href=#>Pure Wow</a> estimates it cost upwards of over $1 million.

He’s trying to claim that he ain’t, but the [porno] world ain’t dumb. We know [because] some other chick that knows [Montana] or that used to date him knows the true scoop, ‘cause he was pimpin’ her [too].”</span></p><p><span>According to Pumper, 29, when Montana (stage name: Chippy D) contacted him and noted her famous father, he was ignorant to the </span><span>Matrix</span><span> star’s celebrity. After doing a little homework on his leading lady, Pumper learned not only did Daddy Fishburne disapprove of his daughter’s career choice, he made it quite clear he was anti new boo.</span></p><p><span>“I heard she was getting allowance and had a car [from her father],” he says. “[She] was getting money from her dad but the dad broke all that off ‘cause the dad didn’t approve of the boyfriend.”</span></p><p><span>Against the wishes of her father, who ironically played pimpish legend </span><strong><span>Ike Turner</span></strong><span> to sterling results in </span><span>What’s Love Got To Do With It</span><span>, Chippy has pursued on-camera dreams her way with her most recent exhibition seen in B Pumper’s </span><span>Phattys, Rhymes & Dimes 14</span><span>. While Pumper considers Montana’s appearance a coup for his Freaky Empire and </span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>rap career</span></a><span>, he feels certain that she was persuaded to get low by a pimp who happened to be one of his fans.</span></p><p><span>“Love is real deep and once you get a bitch heart, [she’ll] bend over backwards and do a backflip for a nigga.”&nbsp;—</span><span>Bonsu Thompson</span></p><p><span>Stay tuned to VIBE.com for the in-depth Q&A with B Pumper on Montana-gate, rap ambitions and Beyoncé.</span></p><p><span><span><strong><span>SEE ALSO:</span></strong></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6t6psTCpaysoaaaerG70adkrKyRp3qjec%2BupKmdomLAosXSZqSopqSWu6J5xaKqoZqlp7umedaaqmaomaK9prCMbmpwbmlk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

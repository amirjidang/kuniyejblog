The show ran for four seasons and when she decided not to continue filming, it was canceled. Kat Von D credits her grandmother for inspiring her music and art. She left school at 16 and pursued a career as a tattoo artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, Kat decided to try the make-up industry by launching a make-up line for Sephora. Since then, she started releasing new collections every year growing the line massively. In January 2020, the tattoo artist took to Instagram to announce that after 12 years, she was quitting her make-up brand and has sold her shares to the parent company, Kendo.</p><p>Kat wanted more time to work on other things in her life, especially after she felt the industry had changed too much for her liking.

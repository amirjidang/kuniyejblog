But in today’s rap-scape, there was enough limelight for all the women to shine on the mic.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I think it’s fire. It’s a whole different ball game. Whole different crop of young superstars and styles,” the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GRAMMY award-winning rapper</a> told Kevin. “I think, to me the… I’ve been feeling like this for, maybe, a year or two. I hate to say it, almost because it sounds like pandering, but I do think, there’s a lot of fire female rappers.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NUP_201614_00007.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I feel like they doing some of the most exciting [music] commercially.

Now, it’s like, we getting moments, and moments, and moments. I think that’s hard.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in the discussion, Cole opened up about his relationship with his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>mental health, specifically meditation</a>. The Dreamville head honcho spoke about how a new publicist helped him find his way back to the individualized technique.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So I got with this new publicist, Kathryn Frazier, and she’s [an] amazing woman. She was telling me how she was into meditation, transcendental meditation. And I had flirted with it in my early twenties, practice it a little bit..didn’t know what I was doing, but had a nice little experience. But I didn’t dive into it. But mind you, her telling me about that was coinciding with me, realizing, yo, something, something’s going on.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">J.

Don’t search your name,” he added. “I had set some rules for myself, some baseline<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> rules like, yo, don’t go on Twitter</a>. Don’t read your replies.That’s rule number one. Number two, when you’re creating, you got to create from a pure place only. That was a rule I set for myself. Everything has to only be truly what you feel in your heart.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The latest episode of Kevin Hart’s&nbsp;Hart to Heart&nbsp;series will begin streaming on Thursday (July 27) on Peacock.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch a sneak peek of J.

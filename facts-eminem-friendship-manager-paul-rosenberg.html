If you're an avid fan of Eminem, you may recognize him from the numerous skits on Em's albums. However, things between them go a little deeper than this, and these are 10 facts about their friendship.</p><h2 id=both-are-proud-motor-city-citizens><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Both Are Proud Motor City Citizens</span></h2><p>Eminem is known for his loyalty to Detroit. Even though he was born in Missouri, young Marshall grew up on the streets of Motor City, going from one high school to another. Em's manager, Paul Rosenberg, also grew up in Detroit. In fact, he was born and bred in the city.</p><p>Speaking of Detroit, Eminem's love for the city is documented throughout his career, notably from the song Detroit vs. Everybody from the ShadyXV compilation album and the 'Marshall From Detroit' VR interview with Sway Calloway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=prior-to-meeting-eminem-paul-rosenberg-was-a-fresh-graduate-from-the-university-of-detroit><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Prior to Meeting Eminem, Paul Rosenberg Was a Fresh Graduate From the University of Detroit</span></h2><p>Before meeting Eminem, Paul Rosenberg was just a recently-graduated Mercy Law School student from the University of Detroit.</p><p>Fortunately, his savvy ear for talent landed him a chance to meet young, yet unpolished Eminem, which leads to the next point.</p><h2 id=before-becoming-a-music-attorney-paul-wanted-to-be-a-musician><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Before Becoming a Music Attorney, Paul Wanted to Be a Musician</span></h2><p>Prior to graduating from university, young Rosenberg was a part of a grassroots level hip-hop group called Rhythm Cartel from 1989 to 1993 under the moniker 'Paul Bunyan.'

One of the well-known spots in Detroit, The Hip-hop Shop, saw Eminem in the making. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, Rosenberg recalled the first time he met Eminem at the Shop in '97, with fellow rapper and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">D12 member,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Proof,</a> bringing them together.</p><p>"Proof wanted me to check him out because he knew that my goal in law school was to become a music lawyer," said Rosenberg after telling how Proof cleared the area so Eminem could rap, hassle-free, from in the crowd.</p><h2 id=paul-bought-eminem-s-debut-cassette-infinite-for-6-dollars><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Paul Bought Eminem's Debut Cassette, 'Infinite,' for 6 Dollars</span></h2><p>The two immediately clicked. A few months after their first encounter at The Shop, according to Rosenberg, Eminem released his independent debut album, Infinite, which he bought for only $6 on cassette.</p><p>Unfortunately, the album didn't do too well on the market. The rapper sold the tape from door to door, but barely sold 1,000 copies. Radio stations refused to play it, saying that Em 'sounded like AZ and Nas,' which led him to the birth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the notorious, violent Slim Shady persona</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=during-the-early-days-of-his-career-em-was-so-broke-that-he-used-to-sleep-on-paul-s-couch><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>During the Early Days of His Career, Em Was So Broke That He Used to Sleep On Paul's Couch</span></h2><p>The lackluster reception of Infinite gave fans the Slim Shady EP, and from there, Rosenberg finally saw Eminem's full-growth as a rapper with his own voice. He officially became Eminem's manager, and the rapper would visit his New York apartment from time to time.</p><p>"You had cockroaches the size of f*****g mice," Eminem recalled spending the night at Rosenberg's apartment.

Their 2001 debut, Devil's Night, was the label's first-ever album. Shady Records later expanded its wings by signing controversial rapper 50 Cent, who then scored a whopping 800,000 first-week sales for his debut, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Rich or Die Tryin</a>.'</p><h2 id=eminem-is-younger-than-paul-by-only-a-year><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Eminem&nbsp;Is Younger Than Paul By Only a Year</span></h2><p>Marshall Mathers was born on October 17, 1972, while Rosenberg was on August 1, 1971.

Brands from all over the world are jumping onto this delicious bandwagon. Join the movement and read below for our creative, bizarre & yummy food-inspired fashion favorites.</p><h2 id=lemon-print-dress>Lemon-Print Dress</h2><p>The first food item on our spotlight is (drum-roll, please) lemons. We never knew how much the world enjoyed citrus-printed clothing until this year. If you go to <a href=#>Italy</a> without a lemon-print dress; you are committing a major fashion-sin.</p><p>You have so many different options here, but our favorite is Majorelle’s “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Annalise Mini Dress</a>.” You can purchase it on Revolve for $188. It’s the perfect combination of playful and stylish. We love a good periwinkle and the ruffled bottom is&nbsp;an adorable finishing touch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lobster-jacket>Lobster Jacket</h2><p>This one definitely fits into the bizarre part of our headline. Here’s where this question comes into play: just because its couture is it okay to be ridiculously expensive? Well, if you’re a lobster-lover then we can't argue. Court dismissed, bring in the dancing lobsters.</p><p>Libertine’s “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lobster Graphic Jacket</a>” will cost you $2,500. It appears that there is also a matching shirt if you’re feeling very aquatic. Find this unique item at a Neiman Marcus near you.</p><h2 id=bacon-turtle-neck>Bacon Turtle-Neck</h2><p>This one we feel guilty for labeling and putting on this list because it wasn’t intended to look like bacon; but the shoe fits. Designer Asai has established a huge luxury following with its funky tie-dye tops. Granted this one went a little south, literally, it looks like bacon strips.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Celebrity Clothing Lines, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it does look comfortable and light. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Net-A-Porter</a> says it’s “made from ruffled stretch-mesh, it's perfect for tucking into skirts or pants.” Purchase this bacon-esq top there, now on sale with 30% at $266.</p><h2 id=sour-patch-sneakers>Sour Patch Sneakers</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Curry</a> is more than just one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Among many other things, he is extremely creative when it comes to his sneaker lines with Under Armour. Their newest creation is called the “Curry 7 Sour Patch Kids.”</p><p>They come in two colors: lime and peach, each for $140. The Sour Patch Kids logo is on the shoe and the actual Sour Patch Kids are printed in assorted colors along the heel tab. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The box is even cool</a>: it comes with a nutritional facts sticker but instead of the Sour Patch information its Stephen Curry’s stats.</p><h2 id=sushi-button-down-shirt>Sushi Button-Down Shirt</h2><p>Over the past decade, <a href=#>sushi</a> has made moves in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">culinary world</a>. It’s become the perfect date night food whether you go out or take in. So gentlemen, why not wear a sushi print shirt on your next date?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robert Graham has created a surprisingly nice version of this bizarre concept. The “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Omakase Sushi & Fish Print Classic-Fit Button-Down Shirt</a>” is subtle enough that you can’t really tell its sushi unless you’re analyzing it. And when you do figure out what it is, you’re weirdly impressed. If this floats your boat, purchase it at Bloomingdales for $198.</p><h2 id=fruit-salad-mules>Fruit Salad Mules</h2><p>When it comes to fancy slippers, designer Charlotte Olympia is your girl. Her shoes are all super chic, comfortable and different from the rest. These mules are ideal to add just the right amount of flair to your outfit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive SJP Shoes, Ranked</a></span></p><p>They are actually called the “Fruit Salad Mules.” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olympia’s website</a> says that they are, “A nod to the luscious flavors of Rio de Janeiro, these tropical fruit embroidered slides give your look a taste of Brazil.” Originally $495 but you can get them on sale now 50% off for $248.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ice-cream-earrings>Ice Cream Earrings</h2><p>Dessert earrings are a legitimate thing. And honestly, they are really cute. Could you at 25 years old really wear a pair of dessert-inspired earrings and not look crazy? Surprisingly, yes. Recently, BAUBLEBAR has been making all of our favorite earrings. The quality is amazing and the styles are unique.</p><p>BAUBLEBAR’s “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolie Drop</a>” beaded ice cream cone earrings in “multi” is the best $42 you’re ever going to spend on earrings. They have beaded colored rainbow sprinkles, we repeat, beaded sprinkles. The best part: sparkling crystals are literally the cherry-on-top. Where are our fellow mint-chocolate chip ice cream lovers at? They even make a pair in mint.</p><h2 id=pineapple-suit>Pineapple Suit</h2><p>Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? *Sings- SpongeBob SquarePants.* This pineapple suit from OppoSuits, known as the “2-Piece Shineapple Suit,” is made for that one frat guy named Chad, that will do anything to be the center of attention at every party. Chad(s), you can get it at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Belk</a> for $99.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you live in a hot area where you can’t wear a suit but are in love with this set have no fear: it comes sleeveless. Disclaimer: this suit is only acceptable to wear if you promise to keep the pineapple strictly on your clothes and not your pizza.</p><h2 id=pasta-cufflinks>Pasta Cufflinks</h2><p>Mario, vieni a mangiare! La pasta si sta raffreddando! If you come from an Italian family, then you don’t need Google to translate that one; your grandmother has screamed it at the bottom of your staircase every Sunday your entire life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jersey Shore: The Main Characters' Real Life Ages & Relationship Statuses</a></span></p><p>Farfalle pasta cufflinks need to become a staple in every Italian man’s wardrobe. They are even gold and the back is a tiny fork; what could be better? We see absolutely no flaws with this one. Snatch them up at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CuffLinksDepo</a>, for $110.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bedazzled-french-fries-bag>Bedazzled French Fries Bag</h2><p>Even top designers have gotten into the food-fashion trend. Most well-known is Jeremy Scott for his fast-food inspired MOSCHINO line in 2014. To most critics’ surprise, this collection sold out everywhere. The playful combination of the&nbsp;McDonalds x Moschino quilted leather bag has inspired so many others since then. What is better than high fashion and fast food? Nothing.</p><p>Judith Leiber&nbsp;created a knock-out couture food-clutch collection. Adorned with what seems like endless crystals; they are pieces of art. Forget going to a museum, just head over to your local Neiman Marcus and see her display. The must-have bag: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Judith Leiber Couture French Fries Rainbow Clutch Bag</a> for $5,695.00. Remember: food makes everything better, fashion included.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Simple Clothing Ideas That Made People Millionaires</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKypobJwss6om2ahnqi9qr7EnWSfmaOdtrC60maaq52Rqba3sYywnKKqlGKwtsDEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

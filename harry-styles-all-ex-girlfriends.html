Styles exploded onto the scene as part of the megaband, <a href=#>One Direction, churning out hit songs</a> by the dozen. Ever since fans laid eyes on him, he has been in the center of the public eye. The world simply can not get enough of Harry Styles! Everything about him from his fl0wing hair and his trendy style to his creamy crooning makes women everywhere lose their minds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>One Direction 10th Anniversary: The Band Then & Now, In Pictures</a></span></p><p>Harry might be loved by millions of women across the globe, but only a handful of ladies have ever truly gotten to call Harry theirs. <a href=#>Styles (and the rest of the band) has dated some of the most beautiful and talented ladies</a> in the land. While he has had his fair share of pretty women to spend his downtime with, none have stuck around, making him still single and ready to mingle. Here is the rundown of all the women that singer Harry Styles has reportedly been linked to. We can't wait to see who will be next!</p><h2 id=caroline-flack><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Caroline Flack</span></h2><p>The singer romanced the XFactor presenter several years ago, from 2011-2012. The two caught a lot of heat for their relationship because, at the time, Harry was seventeen, and Caroline was fourteen years older than him. This started the "Harry and the ladies" craze, as it was his first publicized relationship with someone else in the entertainment business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For two kids who were constantly scrutinized and judged, the two did a pretty decent job of trying to be a couple. They reportedly ended on good terms, which says a lot. Teenagers can be ruthless with their romances fizzle. Sadly they will never get to reprise their relationship in adulthood because <a href=#>Flack met an untimely end </a>this past February.</p><h2 id=emily-atack><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Emily Atack</span></h2><p>After&nbsp;Styles' romance with Caroline Flack, rumors ramped up regarding the singer and a beautiful British actress by the name of Emily Atack. During the time of the rumors, neither Atack nor Styles confirmed or denied that they were an item. They stayed quiet about what they might or might not be.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>&nbsp;Which Harry Styles Song Are You, Based On Your Zodiac Sign?</a></span></p><p>A few years later, in 2014, Emily finally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented on her flame</a>, Harry. She said that the couple wasn't boyfriend and girlfriend, but merely two famous youngsters who were bent on having a bit of fun. Following their low-key dalliance, the two simply went their separate ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>One of Harry's most sensationalized relationships was the one he embarked on with America's sweetheart, Taylor Swift, from 2012 to 2013. These were the years that Harry bounced around with women, dating Flack, Atack, Caggie Dunlop, and Emma Ostilly, all in that timeframe.</p><p>Harry and Taylor made use of their romance by supposedly penning famous songs about their time together like "Style," "Out of the Woods," "Perfect," and "Two Ghosts." The relationship between these pop icons might not have lasted forever, but the songs that stemmed from their experiences sure will. Both Harry and<a href=#> Taylor have been known to have a whole lot of possible partners.</a></p><h2 id=nicole-scherzinger><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Nicole Scherzinger</span></h2><p>Singer Nicole Scherzinger and Harry Styles knew each other for years, thanks to the hit show X-Factor.&nbsp;A nineteen-year-old Harry was on the show in 2010 when a much older Nicole sat on the judges' panel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was revealed in 2015 that the two might have had something going on between them in 2013. The two might have had something real going on, or maybe Harry was showing his gratitude to the beauty for her help in assembling his world-famous group. Who knows!</p><h2 id=kimberly-stewart><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kimberly Stewart</span></h2><p>Kimberly Stewart is the daughter of famous musician Rod Stewart, so it didn't surprise anyone to learn that she might have had relations with pop music's "it" guy, Harry Styles. It was Kim's rocker dad who told the world that Harry's car was sometimes parked over at Kim's home in the morning hours.</p><p>He was clearly alluding to the fact that these two sometimes spent evening hours in one another's company. The relationship didn't go anywhere, and Kim seemed to be another notch on Harry's Pretty Lady belt.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kendall Jenner</span></h2><p>Entertainment giant and <a href=#>famous model Kendall Jenner</a> was linked to Harry Styles not once, but twice. The raven-haired beauty and the singing lothario were first seen together in 2013, but reportedly parted ways in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Harry Styles 10 Best Instagram Looks</a></span></p><p>They then rekindled whatever they had started a few years later, in 2015, where they were spotted celebrating New Year's Eve with each other. Kendall's sister, Khlo√©, confirmed that her little sis and the heartthrob were something to one another, but as far as titles went, she wasn't exactly sure what to call them. Whatever they were, it all ended in 2016, when Harry moved on.</p><h2 id=erin-foster><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Erin Foster</span></h2><p>Once Harry moved on from his off-and-on again thing with the famous Kendall Jenner, he might have taken up with Erin Foster. Erin is the&nbsp;former step-sister of <a href=#>Bella Hadid and Gigi Hadid</a>&nbsp;(who is <a href=#>about to have a baby with one of Harry's former bandmates</a>.) The two were spotted around town in October picking pumpkins together, but they never seemed to gain serious traction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If they did start something up, it fizzled out fairly quickly. This could have been partly due to the fact that the two had twelve years between them. Harry does seem to have a bit of a thing for older women.</p><h2 id=sara-sampaio><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sara Sampaio</span></h2><p>Over the course of a few years, Harry dated several beautiful models, including Kendall Jenner, Nadine Leopold, and&nbsp;Sara Sampaio. Harry was spotted locking lips with the&nbsp;Portuguese supermodel in 2015, and later Harry was seen leaving the Victoria's Secret model's hotel room.</p><p>There was no denying that the two of them made a drop-dead gorgeous couple, but being pretty wasn't enough to keep them together. They ended things pretty suddenly, further proving that Harry was headed for a lifetime of bachelorhood.</p><h2 id=georgia-fowler><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Georgia Fowler</span></h2><p>Harry once penned a catchy song called "Kiwi," It is supposedly about one of his ex-flames, Georgia Fowler. The song is about a baby, which Harry doesn't have, at least as far as we know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So maybe he embellished here and there, but there was no denying that a short and sweet something took place between the singer and the New Zealand stunner. Maybe it never went past a friendly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">game of Scrabble</a>. Maybe there was more. Harry and Georgia know the truth, but the rest of us can only speculate how deep this thing between them ran.</p><h2 id=camille-rowe><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Camille Rowe</span></h2><p>Model Camille Rowe might have come the closest to making Harry Styles a one-woman kind of guy. He once again went the Victoria Secret model route when he caught the eye of pretty Camille. Things actually got pretty serious with these two good looking youngsters, and Camille even brought Harry home to meet her family.</p><p>Harry and his gal were photographed out and about, and he was even seen sweetly carrying his lady's purse for her. Unfortunately, after about a year of dating, Harry and Camille broke up, but still! A year of dating Harry Styles? There has to be some kind of trophy or medal for achieving that feat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Facts About Harry Styles That Fans Should Know</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqqirnq0wNilnKxlkaG5brHXZp6iqpybv6qxzZ2qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

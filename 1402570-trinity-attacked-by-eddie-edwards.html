Both then sat out the rest of their contracts and decided to join different promotions. <a href=#>Moné</a> signed with New Japan Pro Wrestling while Trinity signed with IMPACT Wrestling.</p><p>Since making her debut back in April of this year, the former WWE SmackDown Women’s Champion has had a successful run in the promotion. She is the current IMPACT Wrestling Knockouts Champion. Trinity defeated Deonna Purrazo to capture the title. This was the first championship she captured in the promotion.</p><p>Trinity is set to defend her championship at the upcoming Victory Road pay-per-view. Her opponent is none other than Alisha Edwards. The Californian-born wrestler won a Battle Royale to earn her opportunity for the title.</p><p>The two stars were set to sign the contract for their championship match last night on IMPACT Wrestling. Santino Marella played the role of the authority figure who supervised the signing to ensure there were no shenanigans taking place. Sadly, he was unable to prevent the two stars from brawling with each other.</p><p>Things seemed to be going smoothly until Trinity called Eddie Edwards, <a href=#>‘Mr. Alisha’</a>. His wife was unhappy with that remark and she poured a glass of champagne on the former WWE Superstar. This enraged Fatu and it quickly turned into a brawl.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-not-going-out-like-this>Not Going Out Like This</h2><p>As Trinity was looking to Powerbomb Alisha, <a href=#>Eddie</a> interfered and slammed the Knockouts Champion through the same table. The night came to an end with Mr. and Mrs. Edwards standing tall.</p><p>After the segment aired, Trinity posted the following response:</p><p>“Lights upstairs are out lights on my feet are blinking,” she wrote on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. “I’m not going out like this! #VictoryRoad it’s on!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNpaW5vYGLBs7XNoquyZZGpwaKvyp6bZpqpYrKlsMieZJ6cp5a%2Fpb8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

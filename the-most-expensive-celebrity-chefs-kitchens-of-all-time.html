The kitchen also features a cooking fireplace, soapstone counters, and a commercial convection-style double oven for baking. The fridge and freezer drawers are on the island, away from Paula's cooking zone. An appliance cabinet hides modern necessities and provides outlets to maintain the traditional look. The kitchen sink boasts a size comparable to that of a small bathtub.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=guy-fieri>Guy Fieri</h2><p>Guy Fieri, the well-known face of the Food Network, resides in a 3,900 square-foot home with a spacious 900 square-foot kitchen.

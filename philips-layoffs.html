These reasons include:</p><li>A <b>Financial Loss</b> of 1.6 Billion Euros: In 2022, Philips reported a notable financial loss, putting the company in a challenging position and necessitating cost-saving measures.</li><li><b>Sleep Apnea Machine Recall</b>: Philips faced a major setback with the recall of 5.5 million sleep apnea machines worldwide. These devices were found to contain toxic foam, posing potential health risks to users.</li><li>Impact of the <b>Covid-19 Pandemic</b>: The ongoing <b>Covid-19 pandemic</b> has had a profound effect on businesses globally.

Over the next two years, a total of 6,000 jobs will be eliminated as part of the <b>restructuring plans</b>.

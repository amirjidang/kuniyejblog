The actor went on to warm our hearts as 3J in Family Matters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Brown is probably best know for playing Raven Baxter's best friend Eddie Thomas on That's So Raven. However, in recent years Orlando Brown is better know for his scandalous behavior than his talent.</p><h2 id=orlando-brown-has-been-involved-in-a-string-of-controversies>Orlando Brown Has Been Involved In A String Of Controversies</h2><p>After Orlando Brown left Disney in 2007 to pursue a music career, the future seemed bright for the talented star. His songs even appeared in the movie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thirteen</a> starring Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed. Things got a little weird when in early 2016, Brown debuted to the public a new tattoo, that of his former That's So Raven co-star Raven-Symoné, on his neck. His co-star <a href=#>Kyle Massey even joked</a> Brown started to go "crazy" after he slept with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were then dumbstruck when in 2016, Brown was arrested and later charged with domestic battery, obstruction of justice and drug possession. The Sister, Sister actor was also charged with intent to sell and possession of contraband in jail, following an altercation with his then-girlfriend in public. Despite the seriousness of the charges, Brown failed to appear for a scheduled court date.</p><p>He was ultimately taken into custody by police on March 18, 2016, in Barstow, California. But after the Christmas In Compton star was released from jail in Barstow, he again failed to appear for a scheduled court date. He was later apprehended in Las Vegas, Nevada, by bounty hunters.</p><p>The arrests kept coming, as Brown found himself in more hot water after being taken into custody by Las Vegas police while leaving a local hotel known for prostitution and drug use. A subsequent search found him to be in possession of methamphetamine and a pipe. He was arrested for an outstanding warrant and was charged with drug possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and resisting arrest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several months later, on September 2, 2016, Brown was arrested after breaking into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Legends Restaurant & Venue</a>, a Las Vegas establishment owned by his childhood friend. He was seen attempting to change the locks. Police later found Brown on the roof of the building, after security cameras showed him entering the building without permission.</p><h2 id=orlando-brown-39-s-life-seemed-to-be-on-the-right-path-in-2020>Orlando Brown's Life Seemed To Be On The Right Path In 2020</h2><p>In 2020, it seemed that Orlando Brown was back on the straight on narrow. He was in a relationship with a woman named Danielle Brown, and they share a son Frankie. He credited her for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">helping him find God </a>and turn his back on drugs. “My name is Orlando Brown. You may know me from a little show from back in the day called ‘That’s So Raven,’” he said. “I went through a lot. I experimented with crystal meth, with weed. I didn’t know what I was doing. I was addicted to the internet. All kinds of stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“My fiancée told me about this place and when I came it was amazing,” he continued. “I had a blast.

Thanks to Etsy designer <b>Chelsea Shiels</b>, the world now has mermaid crowns, stunning headpieces crafted out of seashells and bedazzled from top to bottom.</p><p><span>The regal pieces, which nearly always sell out within hours once she posts them to her Etsy shop, were first made by Melbourne, Australia–based Shiels, 27, to cover up a scar on her forehead. Inspired by a love of "mermaids and everything to do with the beach and the sea," she made the gorgeous toppers using shells from around the world — and the compliments started rolling in. "[That] gave me the confidence to continue creating them for others," Shiels tells </span><i>Us Weekly</i><span>.</span></p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Shop the 10 Hottest Summer Trends</a></p><p>The artist, who started Chelsea's Flowercrowns with festival-perfect headwear made from artificial buds, adds, "The shell crowns are completely unique, but haven't been seen as fashionable until now. I guess everyone has an inner mermaid, seeing as our generation grew up with <i>The Little Mermaid</i>. Now everyone can be their own Ariel."</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Must-Have Sunscreens to Stockpile for Summer</a></p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: 12 Must-Have Beauty Products to Take on Vacation</a></p><p>While Shiels admits that most of her customers purchase a crown — which range from skinny tiaras to multi-tiered diadems — to wear to more whimsical events, "I personally wear them doing the dishes! They can be worn anywhere." She also makes shell-topped bras, for the full mermaid experience.&nbsp;</p><p>And the best part is? Channeling your inner Ariel actually benefits the environment. "I buy from suppliers that only collect shells from beaches overflowing with them," Shiels tells <i>Us</i>. "My main supplier donates 30 percent of proceeds back into a variety of charities, mainly to help preserve the great barrier reef. I love the ocean! And I assure you I have great suppliers and pay lots of money for my shells for this reason."</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Kys7nAoptmm6KkxK%2B%2FjJqpnmWknbJuusSwZJ%2Bkn6yys3nCq6awpqNivam706iqZq9kaH9xhJho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

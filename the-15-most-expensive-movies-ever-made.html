Quite a few movies are being created&nbsp;with&nbsp;more special effects, CGI or 3D technology, but that also means these types of films require an extremely large budget, much higher than your average flick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to create a great movie, producers need to dish out a lot of money, which usually&nbsp;puts their movies in the category of most expensive to make. &nbsp;Quite often movies with large&nbsp;budgets &nbsp;become the most profitable in the cinematic industry in terms of revenue, but that doesn't always necessarily mean these films are great movies. Whether big bucks were spent on production value and special effect, or assembling a top notch cast of A-listers, these films all broke the bank in one way or another.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 15 most expensive movies ever made:</p><h2 id=15-x-men-the-last-stand-2006---246-1-million><strong>15.</strong><strong>X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) - $246.1 million</strong></h2><p>Via thatfilmguy.net</p><p>X:Men: The Last Stand &nbsp;is part of one of the most popular superhero movie franchises and was&nbsp;released&nbsp;in 2006.

Lewis's wildly&nbsp;popular children's book and the movie soon became a multi-million dollar film production. Most of it was filmed in the UK because of the tax cuts, on account of&nbsp;the producer of the film needing to cut costs, as the production of the film had an exceptionally&nbsp;high budget. &nbsp;A big portion of the cost was due to the visual effects needed in order to create the fantasy world of Narnia. In total, there were 7,000 props, and 200 carpenters building the sets, as well as 35 employees who were hired for the sole purpose of making the props. Thankfully the movie was a box office hit, making the high production cost worth it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The original budget of The&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;of Narnia: Prince Caspian&nbsp;&nbsp;was $225 million and it ended up making &nbsp;$419,665,568 at the box office.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-spider-man-2-2004---250-1-million><strong>13.

Director <a title="Christopher Nolan Net Worth" href=#>Christopher Nolan</a>, never seems to disappoint his fans when it comes to incorporating suspense and action into his movies. Surprisingly enough The Dark Knight Rises was only the third highest grossing film that year. Despite its high budget, it did still bring in a large amount of money, pulling in&nbsp;$1.1 billion at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-avatar-2009---261-million><strong>9.

Instead, he waited ten years to begin working on his film, and the reason was due to the fact that he didn't feel that the technology was good enough at that time to produce the vision he had in mind. The largest expenses for Avatar were graphics and visual effects.</p><p>The original budget was $237 million but the profit the film generated&nbsp;made all the expenses diminish considering Avatar made $3.1 billion at the box office.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-man-s-chest-2006---263-7-million><strong>8</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) - $263.7 million</strong></h2><p>Via drush76.wordpress.com</p><p>Dead Man's Chest came out in 2006 and is the second installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise starring <a title="Johnny Depp Net Worth" href=#>Johnny Depp</a>, <a title="Keira Knightley Net Worth" href=#>Keira Knightley</a> and <a title="Orlando Bloom Net Worth" href=#>Orlando Bloom</a>. Having a cast of A-list celebrities always drives up the cost of a film's production. Johnny's Depp's payment was an estimated $20 million, not to mention that the cost of the props for the movie was massive. The ships used in the film, The Flying Dutchman and The Black Pearl, were actually built just for Dead Man's Chest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The budget for Dead Man's Chest was an estimated $237 million and it ended up grossing $1.2 billion.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-waterworld-1995---271-3-million><strong>7.

The film has been the most expensive animated movie ever made and actually took six years to finish. The reason why it took so long to be released was due to complications with mixed mediums of computer generated imagery and animation all costing the production of the film a lot of money.</p><p>Tangled originally had a budget of $260 million and ended up grossing $590.7 million at the box office.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-spider-man-3-2007---293-9-million><strong>4.

Unfortunately, even though so much money was spent on creating the film it didn't seem to be well received by fans of the Spider-Man films. However, considering all the negative reviews the film got it still grossed $890 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-titanic-1997---294-3-million><strong>3. Titanic (1997) - $294.3 million</strong></h2><p>Via fanpop.com</p><p>In order to create a film as elaborate as Titanic was, a massive budget was definitely in order. Titanic remains&nbsp;one of the most expensive films ever made with a total cost of $294 million, however the large cost of the movie was more than justified&nbsp;considering Titanic brought in $1.8 billion at the box office the first time around, and an extra $343.6 million upon its 3D re-release in 2012. Titanic became the second movie in history to gross over $2 billion at the box office after Avatar.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-cleopatra-1963---339-5-million><strong>2.

However, when adjusted for inflation the 1963 film would have cost&nbsp;$339 million today. For that year, Cleopatra was the highest grossing film, but because of the extremely high budget, it is actually the only high grossing film on this list that suffered a loss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Originally&nbsp;with a budget of&nbsp;$44 million in 1963 the film only generated $26 million &nbsp;at the box office which would equate to just under $200 million in 2015.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-world-s-end-2007---341-8-million><strong>1.

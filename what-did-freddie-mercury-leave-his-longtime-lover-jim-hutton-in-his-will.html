When Queen was in its heyday, however, the band produced a slew of songs that were all embued with a timeless feeling. As a result, even decades after the band was at the height of its success, their music remains noteworthy enough that <a href=#>when other artists rip Queen off, they end up paying the price</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Unbelievable Reason Freddie Mercury Never Fixed His Teeth</a></span></p><p>Of course, everyone knows that every member of the band Queen was supremely talented. That said, there also is no doubt that Freddie Mercury was the group’s biggest star. As a result, there continues to be a lot of interest in Mercury’s life and <a href=#>the singer’s opinion of Queen’s music</a>. For example, there is a lot of interest in what Mercury left behind when he passed away including what his long-time lover Jim Hutton inherited in the singer’s will.</p><h2 id=the-truth-about-freddie-mercury-rsquo-s-love-life>The Truth About Freddie Mercury’s Love Life</h2><p>Before Freddie Mercury became a massive rock star, he was just another singer looking for his big break. While there is no doubt that Mercury always had a powerful voice, there still was no way to know if he would make it before he became a star. As a result, when Mary Austin fell for Mercury before he found success, there was no doubt that her feelings were genuine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After meeting when Mary Austin was 19 and Freddie Mercury was 24, the two of them quickly became a couple. Together from 1970 until 1976, Freddie Mercury and Mary Austin wound up getting engaged and she got to know his parents which is a big deal for obvious reasons. However, Austin and Mercury never wound up getting married as the couple split up after he revealed to her that he was bisexual.</p><p>Despite their romantic relationship ending, it is well known that Freddie Mercury and Mary Austin remained close friends throughout his life. In fact, Mercury once called Austin the love of his life and in 1985 he made how much he cared about her very clear. “The only friend I’ve got is Mary, and I don’t want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that’s enough for me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Almost a decade after Freddie Mercury and Mary Austin’s relationship ended, he got involved in the second significant relationship of his life with Jim Hutton. A hairdresser who met Mercury in a gay bar, Hutton initially rejected the singer’s offer to buy him a drink but after meeting a second time a year and a half later, the pair began dating.</p><p>After falling in love, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Freddie Mercury and Jim Hutton were a couple for the last several years of the singer’s life</a>. While their relationship had some ups and downs just like everyone else, their love for each other seems very clear. After all, Hutton helped nurse Mercury throughout the final stages of the singer’s life when his body was ravaged by complications from AIDS. Keep in mind that AIDS was a terrifying disease at the time and some people wrongly believed you could contract it just by touching someone who had it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About The Biggest Lie From ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’</a></span></p><p>According to Jim Hutton, the last conversation he had with Freddie Mercury took place just before <a href=#>the singer lapsed into a coma and then passed away</a> days later. In their last moments together, Mercury wanted to look at his art collection so Hutton offered to carry his love to the paintings he owned. Ultimately, Mercury carefully walked to his painting while holding a banister with Hutton lovingly staying by his side to catch him if he fell. From there, the couple shared one final moment as they appreciated great pieces of art together.</p><h2 id=what-did-freddie-mercury-leave-his-longtime-lover-jim-hutton-in-his-will>What Did Freddie Mercury Leave His Longtime Lover Jim Hutton In His Will?</h2><p>When Freddie Mercury took to the stage and performed for his legions of fans, he had the innate ability to get audiences to go on a ride with him. As a result of the showmanship he exhibited on stage and how amazingly powerful Mercury’s voice was, the idea that he would die young just seems wrong. Despite that, when Mercury was only 45-years-old, the beloved singer passed away due to complications from AIDS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Freddie Mercury passed away, it became clear that he provided for the two people he had long relationships with. However, Mercury left the vast majority of his estate to his former girlfriend Mary Austin. As for his longtime boyfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercury left Hutton £500,000</a> which would not be worth roughly $1 million today due to inflation. While there is no doubt that is a significant amount of money for anyone to receive, Hutton wound being forced to spend a lot of that sum soon after he got it for a sad reason.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Was Freddie Mercury And Mary Austin's Relationship Really Like?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the last several years of Freddie Mercury’s life, he lived with Jim Hutton. While it seems clear that Mercury loved Hutton, he still left his home to his former girlfriend and close friend Mary Austin. As a result, when Mercury passed away and Austin inherited his home, she reportedly gave Hutton three months to get out. Forced to quickly find a new residence, Hutton spent a good amount of his inheritance moving to Ireland.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The 10 Best Freddie Mercury Quotes</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGqsIyfqZ6clJ6ybrnEq5quqqliuaat1Z5koaGjYrmwusatoKadXaG8t7HRZqGipV2dwrXAzqdkoqZdnba0edaio6Vn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

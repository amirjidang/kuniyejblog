She is one of the mothers featured on the popular MTV series, “Teen Mom”, the spin-off of the original series, “16 & Pregnant.” Ms. Portwood’s participation in the show has been controversial, as her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, the father of her daughter, has been dotted with bouts of violence. She was ultimately arrested for domestic violence against her ex and was also found to have possession of marijuana and crack cocaine. Her unstable state led to a suicide attempt in the summer of 2011, and in the winter of 2011, she was again caught with drugs. After violating her probation, she was sentenced to five years in jail but was allowed a reprieve if she checked into rehab. She did not, and in February, she was again sent back to court.</p><p>On November 4, 2013, Portwood was released from Indiana’s Rockville Correctional Facility. She is currently engaged with Matt Baier whom she met over the microblogging site, Twitter in 2014. Meanwhile, she and her ex-fiance Gary agreed to share 50-50 custody to their daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1flrqjsdFmp6iqpKy8sLDSZpmip5enrrG02GadmpukYrCivsSeqWaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

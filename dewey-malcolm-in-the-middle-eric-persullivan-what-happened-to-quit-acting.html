Many of people saw themselves in Frankie Muniz's character Malcolm who doesn't feel like he fits in with his siblings and parents. He loves his family but he has a higher IQ than them, and like everyone, he just wants to belong. Of course, fans could also relate to Malcolm's younger brother Dewey, who is the fourth kid... that is, before Jamie is born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We want to know <a href=#>where the Malcolm In The Middle cast is now</a>, including <a href=#>star Justin Berfield</a>.

One asked in a Reddit thread why he hasn't attended reunions with the rest of the cast, and a fan responded that the actor who played Dewey seems to want to stay private. The fan wrote, "he doesn't join reunions because he’s been out of the public eye.

This also allowed Erik's mom to go to Boston to see her husband.</p><p>It definitely sound like Erik was part of the family.

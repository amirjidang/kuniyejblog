And yeah, that’s really it. Just hanging out, having some fun.”</p><p>LaPaglia and Bryan, 27, first sparked dating rumors after they were <a href=#>spotted together in a TikTok video</a> with a group of friends. They added fuel to the fire in June when <a href=#>LaPaglia joined Bryan on stage</a> at Forest Hills Stadium in New York City for a performance of “Revival” during his Burn Burn Burn American Tour.</p><p>LaPaglia went on to call the online conversation surrounding her love life “crazy,” telling her podcast cohost, <strong>Grace O’Malley</strong>, “For some reason, I thought I was never gonna have to say it. I thought it was gonna be, like, the one thing from the internet that I could keep a secret.”</p><p>She continued: “It just sucks with the internet how they speculate and s—t with timelines and stuff. And yeah, it’s just stupid, so I figured I’d just say it before the whole internet gets to say who I am and what I’m doing.”</p><p>For now, LaPaglia said she’s “happy” about her connection with Bryan and is excited to see “where it goes.” She noted: “I have the people in my life that I care about. They know what I’m doing. They know the timeline of things. Why should I even care about the people on the internet that just make s—t up? It’s just stupid.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rianna-LaPaglia-Confirms-She-s-Hanging-Out-With-Singer-Zach-Bryan.jpg><p>Though she didn’t specify when the pair’s relationship began, they crossed paths earlier this year at the <a href=#>2023 ACM Awards</a>. LaPaglia titled a <a href=#>May 22 YouTube vlog</a> “Meeting Zach Bryan at the American Country Music Awards.”</p><p>In addition to including a “Zach Bryan count” for every time she mentioned his name in the video, LaPaglia shared footage of herself freaking out after <a href=#>meeting Bryan on the red carpet</a>.</p><p>“I’m sitting there, like, ‘I don’t know how to talk to you unless I’m flirting. I want to respect your boundaries, sir. Can we please have a picture?’” she recalled of their interaction. “[He’s] the nicest man I’ve ever met in my entire life. … We met Zach Bryan and we haven’t stopped smiling.”</p><p>In a <a href=#>clip teasing Thursday’s podcast</a>, fans were quick to notice that LaPaglia was sporting a black and white baseball cap similar to one Bryan has worn in <a href=#>several recent Instagram posts</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rianna-LaPaglia-Confirms-She-s-Hanging-Out-With-Singer-Zach-Bryan-copy.jpg><p>Bryan, for his part, has not directly addressed the speculation. He was previously married to <strong>Rose Madden</strong> from 2020 to 2021, later sparking a romance with now-ex <strong>Debra Peifer</strong>. Bryan announced weeks after the 2023 ACMs that he and Peifer had called it quits.</p><p>“For transparency and with respect I am letting everyone know Debra and me went our separate ways about a week and a half ago,” he <a href=#>tweeted</a> on May 31. “Things are mutual between us, we’re leaving with plenty [of] memories and good times. I beg so much that everyone respects her and my privacy through a hard time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmWu6%2BtjKWYqZmXobaiecCdm6udo6iytHnRrqSoqqNiwKmx0mabmqyZo7Ruv8innp6qXa%2BupLSMm6mymZ5k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

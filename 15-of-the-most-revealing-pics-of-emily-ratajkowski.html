Since appearing as the ‘voiceless topless woman’ everyone remembers so vividly, <a href=#>Emily&nbsp;Ratajkowski</a> has shot to fame and gone on to become one of the hottest women in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps it’s thanks to her role in the controversy or the fact that she doesn’t shy away from showing off her perfect curves. Follow Emily on social media and you’ll soon discover her snaps and selfies are pure internet gold. Having your breath taken away by Miss Ratajkowski isn’t a difficult task to accomplish and her recent string of selfies is proof of this. Simply browse her latest posts and it’s a done deal.&nbsp;At the end of the day though, no one really cares about your friend’s kids or what kind of salad you had for lunch. These days it’s all about the side-boob and mastering the art of the "Belfie," so can you really blame her?</p><p>But no one can deny that the 25-year-old’s future is bright and that she has never looked hotter. The American model turned actress is now a welcome face in Hollywood. Whether she's in a pair of boyfriend jeans or a tiny two piece, Emily Ratajkowski sure knows how to steal the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So in celebration of some of the world’s best selfies and revealing snaps, we decided to do a round-up of the beauty's best bare-all shots to welcome in the New Year. Without further ado, we present to you 15 of the most revealing selfies featuring Emily Ratajkowski.</p><h2 id=15-that-time-emily-owned-it-riding-bareback-naked><strong>15. That Time Emily Owned It Riding Bareback, Naked</strong></h2><p>The world has become more than just a tad bit familiar with her array of nude selfies and she has since gone on to defend her pics to the press saying ‘My body, my choice.’</p><p>Enter the Harper's Bazaar shoot, which sees Emily naked on a horse, and all hell breaks loose. <a href=#>Piers Morgan </a>went on air to accuse her of playing into the hands of sexist rules rather than breaking them. The former CNN broadcaster took to social media and posted a comment on Ratajkowski's photos saying "Do you want me to buy you some clothes? You look freezing."</p><p>In a moment to end all Twitter rants Emily calmly responded with "@piersmorgan thanks, but I don't need clothes as much as you need press." You go girl!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-that-time-emily-tried-to-cover-her-boobs><strong>14. That Time Emily Tried To Cover her Boobs</strong></h2><p>We all know Emily Ratajkowski is absolutely gorgeous as she graces tabloid after tabloid and billboard after billboard, but just how familiar are you with the London-born, Californian-based model?</p><p>The model turned actress is so much more than just a pretty face as she proves she has pretty assets as well. In another candid shot we see Emily featured in Jacquie Aiche’s Spring 2016 campaign. Emily went on to say: "I love how each piece from JA is a little treasure and can be worn as such, or that you can pile on more and more. There is so much room for personal style in Jacquie’s Jewellery”.</p><p>She stripped down in the racy spread but we can’t help but think perhaps the jewelry stripped down for Emily Ratajkowski as it’s undoubtedly one of her sexiest shoots yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-that-time-emily-had-a-bubble-bath><strong>13. That Time Emily Had A Bubble Bath</strong></h2><p>It’s safe to say the British-born stunner has no problem with nudity. And let’s be honest, neither do her fans or the team over here at The Richest. For those who couldn’t get enough of Emily Ratajkowski on Twitter or Instagram, now you can head on over to her Snapchat page for even more pics.</p><p>In one of our favourite posts to make our 15 of the most revealing pics featuring Emily Ratajkowski, we see the gorgeous model take to Snapchat to post a bathtub selfie. We couldn’t help but include the racy pic as we see the aspiring model is naked and wet after all. Isn’t she just a sight for sore eyes? Sporting minimal make-up, a whole lot of bubbles and a smile, she showed off her natural beauty. And we couldn't be happier with the result.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-that-time-emily-showed-us-her-marble><strong>12. That Time Emily Showed Us her Marble</strong></h2><p>Naked bathroom selfies sure are Emily’s favourite and it tops the list for us as well, even if it means a bunch of controversy will follow. In an interview with Oyster magazine, the 25-year-old model and actress said: “It took me a long time to not take personally the way people write me off; it took me a long time to realise that [it was] ideas our culture has drilled into people about what it means to be an attractive woman and a woman who plays into what sexy is. I always had an anger — I don’t know if anger is too harsh of a word, but a resistance to ever letting anyone write me off. But it wasn’t until I was little older that I realised, ‘Holy sh*t, this is sexism.'” We're just glad Emily wants to share.</p><h2 id=11-the-time-emily-posed-in-her-calvins><strong>11. The Time Emily Posed In Her Calvins</strong></h2><p>Back by popular demand- Emily Ratajkowski snaps another topless selfie for her Insta fans in a memorable post. Wearing nothing but a pair of boyfriend jeans and her Calvins, Emily shows off her golden brown tan as well as her famous curves. The racy pic shows the model going semi-nude, amazing abs and all. She’s made waves in the world of fashion but something tells us this time it’s for a different reason. Let’s just say it’s not exactly her fashion sense that has our attention this time around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this pic, Emily smoulders in a way that looks absolutely effortless as she has just the right amount of attitude and pout in the #mycalvins brand campaign. The brunette model's cleavage always seems to be the topic of conversation and with a saucy snap like this she can’t blame us…</p><h2 id=10-that-time-emily-lay-topless-on-the-floor><strong>10. That Time Emily Lay Topless On The Floor</strong></h2><p>What kind of list would this be if it didn't have more naked selfies. This time around the English-American beauty gets pulses racing with a topless selfie to her Instagram page.</p><p>The busty model can be seen topless in this provocative post which shows her flashing more than just her beautiful visage. Here you can witness first hand her ridiculously toned abs as well as major boob as she struggles to cover her ample cleavage. Just when you thought Emily’s social media pages couldn’t get any hotter, the model uploads this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The brunette bombshell can also be seen flaunting her other assets as she heats things up on her vacation to Greece as well as her photo shoot with Harper’s Bazaar so scroll down the list to see her bare-all on pretty much all social media.</p><h2 id=9-life-s-a-peach><strong>9. Life’s A Peach</strong></h2><p>Making waves are we! Hottie Emily Ratajkowski sent pulses racing as she posted a completely naked pic whilst vacationing on the island of Santorini, Greece. She’s known for uploading semi to completely nude shots and on her recent Mediterranean holiday the model did not disappoint. She wasted no time in stripping off and made use of the private Jacuzzi in her hotel room. So in short it took about 60 seconds in total for Emily to make our day.</p><p>The model-of-the-moment went on to show a few pics of Santorini- which is known for its spectacular views- and then a few views of a different variety. No, we’re not still talking about the island. Emily's vacation pics are close to perfection and she describes her latest Grecian vacation to the Seitan Limania Beach in Akrotiri as "truly the most beautiful place I've ever seen." We can’t help but agree.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-the-infamous-dress-for-harper-s-bazaar><strong>8. The Infamous Dress For Harper’s Bazaar</strong></h2><p>In our first revealing snap, courtesy of 25-year-old Emily Ratajkowski, we are reminded of the model’s ample, perky, oh-so-perfect cleavage. The gorgeous London-born model attended the Harper's Bazaar celebration of "ICONS By Carine Roitfeld" at The Plaza Hotel. She posted a few selfies to her Instagram page before dazzling on the red carpet- all for us to truly appreciate her perfect curves.</p><p>Showcasing her famous assets to perfection, Emily chose a daring ensemble which ultimately got her into a lot of hot water with the press. Let’s just say the outfit consisted of a tiny bit of fabric and a whole lot of glue. The black, shimmering Julien Macdonald designer number was slashed to the navel and exposed the model’s infamous assets and toned, tiny midriff. High expectations are the order of the day when it comes to Emily’s wardrobe attire and she certainly did not disappoint with this brave choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-sun-s-out-buns-out><strong>7. Sun’s Out, Buns Out</strong></h2><p>Is there anything better in life than an afternoon of sun, sand, and selfies? We don’t think so either as this cheeky shot of Emily Ratajkowski’s perky derriere proves that life's a beach. Posing as she showcased her gorgeous profile with her back to the camera, the petite model showcased her perfectly rounded derriere and model-worthy legs for the world to see.</p><p>The shoot took place in honour of Amore and Sorvete Australia’s summer catalogue back in 2016 and sees her&nbsp;natural beauty in a collection of teeny-tiny bikinis in almost-there sizes and colours.</p><p>Judging by her Instagram and Snapchat newsfeed it seems that the 25-year-old model feels at ease in nothing but a teeny-tiny bikini so who are we to stand in her way?</p><h2 id=6-that-time-emily-had-us-wishing-we-were-back-in-bed><strong>6. That Time Emily Had Us Wishing We Were Back In Bed</strong></h2><p>In one of her most natural and raw selfies, Emily shows off her natural beauty in an early morning selfie, straight from her bed. She sports little to no makeup and wears nothing but a delicate chain around her neck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Good Morning Britain host <a href=#>Piers Morgan</a> slammed the "Blurred Lines" star and held nothing back as he took to his Twitter page in a <a href=#>Trump</a>-like social media rage, “All in the name of feminism!” “Way to go Emily, you shameless slapper.”</p><p>In a separate message, he went on to say “Any woman who thinks sending naked selfie Christmas cards promotes feminism is as ridiculous as Emily Ratajkowski.” Then followed that statement up with, “Women like @emrata & @KimKardashian influence millions of young girls on social media. Their naked selfies equals empowerment message is BS.”</p><p>Something tells us Morgan didn’t make it onto Emily’s Christmas List last year and won’t be there for many years to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-beach-selfies-for-the-win><strong>5. Beach Selfies For The Win</strong></h2><p>When it comes to beach belfies and bathtub selfies, Emily Ratajkowski’s social media pages sure are on fire. Take for instance this Santorini beach belfie- one which sent pulses racing. The 25-year-old model showcases her "ass-ets" to perfection in a cheeky two-piece that showed off her holiday tan and natural curves. The beautiful Mediterranean coast was second best in comparison. Posing with her back to the camera the model showcased her perfectly rounded derriere and enviably slender legs in full view. Cutting the shot off from the shoulders down, her famous face unfortunately didn’t make it into the shot, but nonetheless the 25-year-old model-of-the-moment is seen looking flawless. From her "Blurred Lines" music video to her shoot with Harper’s Bazaar, the brunette beauty never neglects to warm things up.</p><h2 id=5-the-infamous-topless-selfie-with-kim-k><strong>5. The Infamous Topless Selfie with Kim K</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Emily revealed how this signature selfie came to be with the Selfie Queen herself, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian West</a>: “I didn’t know her personally, but Kim posted this naked selfie in March, and there were black bars on her private areas. And there was this uproar, especially from Piers Morgan, who wrote this whole thing about “she’s a mother, she’s 35, and it’s ridiculous. . . That made me really angry. She wrote a few tweets responding to all the hate she was getting from this post, and then Piers said Kanye [West] had written those tweets, which also infuriated me to no end. So I issued a series of tweets; she sent me flowers, thanking me, which was very sweet. We ended up running into each other and had this idea to take a similar selfie with our middle fingers up.”</p><p>Emily went on to say: “The whole idea is that when Kim takes a nude selfie, she’s just seeking attention. That’s not the issue. A woman can be seeking attention and also make a statement. They don’t need to be mutually exclusive.” We think she's right.</p><h2 id=3-the-time-she-wore-body-paint-for-sports-illustrated><strong>3. The Time She Wore Body Paint for Sports Illustrated</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And what would this list be for if to not have Emily Ratajkowski turning heads once more. This time the sexy model had one of her more revealing pics published in Sports Illustrated, wearing nothing but a seductive smile and some body paint. That’s right, she is seen modeling a faux bikini made completely out of body paint. One of the things about this stunning model is that she is not afraid to get naked and we have seen a huge amount of Emily over the years.</p><p>She revealed that she finds nudity empowering and insisted that baring all simply isn’t about “seeking attention” as it is also a powerful way to make a statement. To that end she said, “The world should not be exclusive of the ideal body. It has to include all ideals, all bodies.”</p><h2 id=2-another-day-another-nude><strong>2. Another Day, Another Nude</strong></h2><p>Think it’s easy cultivating a double-digit social media following that reaches millions? Think again. But luckily for us Emily continues to delight and entertain us with her cheeky nude snaps for all of her 10 million followers to see. Fancy seeing Emily in all her naked glory? Well your wish is her command as she posted yet another bathtub selfie whilst indulging in a glass of vino.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She may have revealed her thoughts in Harper’s Bazaar regarding posting selfies and the attention that nude pics bring along with it but that didn’t stop her from being her natural self. “Sex is normal. Desire is normal. Attention is normal, and that’s okay,” she says during the interview in the August 2016 issue of Harper’s Bazaar magazine.</p><p>She continued, “I’m a young woman who lives in a world of social media; I’ll post boring things too!” That may be true Emily, but until such time we’ll continue to keep an eye out on your Insta feed…</p><h2 id=1-that-time-she-stripped-down-for-harper-s-bazaar><strong>1. That Time She Stripped Down For Harper’s Bazaar</strong></h2><p>Coming&nbsp;in at number one on our list of the most revealing selfies featuring Emily Ratajkowski is her latest shoot with Harper’s Bazaar. The striking model goes naked and can be seen horseback riding. Once again she takes issue with those who would body-shame her, saying, “We are more than just our bodies, but that doesn’t mean we have to be shamed for them or our sexuality.” We couldn't agree more with Emily's stance on empowerment through revealing selfies and photo shoots. Then again, it's Emily's pics we're talking about, after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They say there’s nothing like experiencing the great outdoors on horseback...naked. After seeing Emily Ratajkowski in the August issue, we tend to agree…</p><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>harpersbazaar</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ks27Ax55kpqejqXqzsdWemKWhnpx6sbXCrGSonl2auqq42GapmqyRn7iww9KkoGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

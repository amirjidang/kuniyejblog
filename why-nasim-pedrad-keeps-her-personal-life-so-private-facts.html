The actress got her big break back in 2009 when she joined the cast of NBC's <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>, where she remained as a lead player up until her departure in 2014. Nasim later made waves as a cast member on both Mulaney and of course, <a href=#>New Girl,</a> where she appeared alongside Zooey Deschanel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her time on both series, Nasim was romantically tied to both John Mulaney and Lamore Morris, however, the actress never spoke out regarding the rumors, leading fans to grow more and more interested in her dating life. Considering Pedrad has remained quite silent on her personal life, it's no surprise that viewers wonder who she's dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Trolls Admit That Kim Kardashian Smashed Her 'SNL' Gig</a></span></p><p>The former SNL star has also appeared in countless rom-coms, including <a href=#>Netflix'</a>Desperados and No Strings Attached. Although she's played in a handful of romance films, it appears as if Nasim is the queen of keeping her real-life romances on the down-low.</p><h2 id=nasim-pedrad-keeps-her-dating-life-private>Nasim Pedrad Keeps Her Dating Life Private</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nasim Pedrad first popped up on our screens back in 2009 when she landed the role of a lifetime on the hit NBC series, Saturday Night Live. Considering her role as a lead player catapulted her to A-list status, many fans became interested in the actor's personal life, mainly when it came to who she is dating.</p><p>Well, sucks for fans, because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nasim is very private about her personal life</a>, and well...rightfully so! While celebrities can totally keep things off-limits to the public, it seems as if Nasim has taken that to the next level, as she's never been tied to any rumors or high-profile relationships since her start in Hollywood. While she documents a lot of her life on social media, it's mostly photos from behind the scenes and film sets, proving she keeps things professional at all times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-rumored-to-be-dating-lamorne-morris>She Was Rumored To Be Dating Lamorne Morris</h2><p>Although she has managed to avoid any major scandal or relationship rumors, Nasim has gotten off scot-free. The actress has, in fact, been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">romantically linked to Lamorne Morris</a>. The duo were first rumored to be dating when their on-screen characters, Aly and Winston in New Girl turned romantic. Fans immediately wondered if their television chemistry extended to real life, a question that only grew when they appeared alongside each other in Desperados.</p><p>Lamorne has also popped up on Nasim's Instagram a handful of times, of course, it was on set or in group settings, however, that seems to be enough for fans to assume the two are dating IRL. Despite their powerful chemistry, which is hard to come across, the duo has never confirmed anything, leading us all to believe that they are simply on-screen lovers and nothing more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things Most Fans Don't Know About John Mulaney</a></span></p><h2 id=nasim-surrounds-herself-with-close-friends>Nasim Surrounds Herself With Close Friends</h2><p>While Nasim Pedrad might keep her romances away from the public eye, her friendships are always on full display. The actress has developed a close relationship with many A-list stars, a handful of which she's shared screentime with. Nasim is quite close to fellow actress, Cristin Milioti, who has made an appearance on Pedrad's Instagram a number of times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nasim is also close to John Mulaney, which makes sense considering the two appeared together on the 2014 series, Mulaney. Although she might not be dating, or so we think, one thing remains clear when it comes to Nasim Pedrad, that she's a hustler! The actress puts a lot of focus into her work, and with her own series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chad having been picked up by TBS</a>, it's clear that staying single just might be the perfect formula for her success.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Much Was Megan Fox Paid On 'New Girl'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdo660tcxmp56copaxbrfEnqesZZiav268xKuqqKaRoXqttcWeZKynXaW%2FqsLArZxmnpGYwbR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

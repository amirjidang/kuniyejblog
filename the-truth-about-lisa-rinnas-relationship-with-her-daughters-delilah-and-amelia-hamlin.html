Lisa posted a picture on&nbsp;social media of her wearing the dress and of Delilah in it, and she got nostalgic for a moment when she wrote, "I was 6 1/2 months pregnant with @delilahbelle we were going to the 1998 #Oscars and @phillipbloch had @versace make me this dress! Here Delilah wears the dress I was pregnant with her in! Can you Believe?!"</p><p>Delilah posted herself wearing the dress to her Instagram stories and wrote, "Got to try on mama's vintage versace that she wore while pregnant with me."

According to&nbsp;The List, Lisa was an employee at a store that sold eyeglasses, and she showed up at a restaurant to give the owner the keys. Harry was friends with the store's owner and so he was there, and&nbsp;they first met each other. Harry said,&nbsp;"It was sparks right away."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa and Harry tied the knot in 1997 and gave birth to Delilah in 1998 and Amelia in 2001.</p><p>Fans of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&nbsp;have seen many scenes where Lisa goes to a cafe or restaurant with her daughters and they seem to have a really nice, supportive relationship.</p><p>Amelia spends a lot of time with her family, and&nbsp;in June 2021,&nbsp;Amelia got together with her mom and grandmother.

While she did say that it was a huge surprise to hear about Amelia dating an older person,</p><p>According to&nbsp;E!

She said,&nbsp;"Sometimes it's hard to accept what you are going through. But really, it’s okay not to be okay.

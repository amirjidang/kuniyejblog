There is no information about whether Khloe Kardashian settled the lawsuit. It's possible that if Good American did settle and pay Whitehead the money that she was asking for, it would be kept out of the news.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/emma-grede.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Khloe doesn't appear to have commented on this Good American lawsuit.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Khloe-Kardashian-Has-Gone-Through-Significant-Changes-Aside-From-Her-Physical-Appearance.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Was Khloe Kardashian’s Weight Loss Healthy?

Sending anyone having a DAY like this lots of love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kristen-Doute-Splits-From-BF-Alex-Denies-Getting-Back-With-Ex-Carter-001.jpg><p>Doute went on to call it a “really sad day,” tearfully thanking her “ride or die” friend <strong>Zack Wickham</strong> for helping pack up her things. “Silver lining: I got my cute chairs out of storage,” she captioned another Story.</p><p>The Bravo personality also uploaded a photo of herself standing in front of a mirror. “Bye beautiful home,” she wrote. “We had so many awesome memories… as heavy as it is, my current mood is gratitude.”</p><p>Days prior, <a href=#>Doute seemingly hinted</a> at the end of her relationship with an Instagram caption about introducing “the new me,” and fans were quick to speculate about her status in the comments. One eagle-eyed social media user pointed out that the <a href=#>James Mae T-shirt designer</a> and Menache were no longer following each other on the platform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kristen-Doute-Splits-From-BF-Alex-Denies-Getting-Back-With-Ex-Carter-002.jpg><p>The <a href=#>former SUR employee</a> went on to address a few fans’ comments, explaining that her relationship with Menache simply “didn’t work out.” In screenshots shared by a <a href=#>Bravo fan account</a>, she added, “Alex is a wonderful man who I love and respect very much.”</p><p>When another user wondered whether Doute would get back together with <a href=#>off-on ex <strong>Brian Carter</strong></a>, who goes by his last name, the reality star shut down the rumors. “Carter and I are friends,” she replied. “Nothing more. Period. Everyone stop speculating.”</p><p><a href=#>Us Weekly broke the news</a> of Doute’s romance with Menache in April 2020, one month before they went Instagram official. “This makes my heart so happy! You deserve all the happiness in the world my love,” then-costar <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> gushed in May 2020. “You have such a big heart and always give and put others first! It’s YOUR turn to be happy!!!!! @menache2society ❤️❤️❤️ all the feels.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later that month, the Michigan native <a href=#>shared more insight</a> into <a href=#>how she connected</a> with Menache. “I really took my time with Alex and I really had to just lay it all out there and say this is who I am. This is what I’ve been through. You have a choice to make and either way it’s cool,” she exclusively told Us, calling the drama-free relationship “refreshing.”</p><p>At the time, Doute was hopeful that fans would <a href=#>see more of Menache</a> on Vanderpump Rules, but she was fired in June 2020 for past racially insensitive behavior. <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong>, <strong>Max Boyens</strong> and<strong> Brett Caprioni</strong></a> were also axed by the network before <a href=#><strong>Jax Taylor</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a> announced their exits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavmZ6ZsrO81KanZqqlobK0ecqroKyslaN6pbvUrZxmmZyaxW65xKeYnKCVYsCxuMitZJqepJq%2Fbn6MspyaqqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

And it’s safe to say that the singer nearly stole the show thanks to outfit changes that were just as exciting as the celeb-studded red carpet.</p><p>Over the course of the “10,000 hours-long” ceremony (hey, Keys said it first), the singer changed ensembles a total of five times. She opened the show wearing a silver sequined Versace one-shoulder gown and ended it in a black jumpsuit with what looks like bedazzled boob tape and colorful over-the-knee Versace boots.</p><p>In between, fashion stylist Jason Bolden helped Keys choose a variety of statement-making ‘fits, one of our favorites being a silver sequined denim-on-denim outfit worth using as street style inspo. Underneath the jean jacket, she wore a camel-colored crop top and for shoes, she went for high platform boots.</p><p>Another one of the night’s iconic looks was a bright pink pantsuit, featuring a cropped blazer and wide-leg pants, which she styled with sparkly silver heels.</p><p>Keys looked amazing, but that’s not to say that it wasn’t a difficult evening for her following the tragic passing of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kobe Bryant</strong></a> and his 13-year-old daughter, <strong>Gianna Maria-Onore Bryant</strong> earlier in the day. Wearing the aforementioned Versace gown, Keys sang a tribute to all of the victims of the accident with <strong>Boyz II Men</strong> at the start of the ceremony.</p><p>“Tonight was tough but we made it through,” said Keys in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> after the show. “Tonight felt like a roller coaster and we were connected through it all. I felt your energy tonight like no other 💜💜. I can’t even express how I feel right now. So much love. Let’s hold each other close. Life is too short and unexpected.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued, “Kobe and Gianna lifted us up tonight. Strength, support, love and blessings to the Bryant family 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 And to all the amazing artists sharing your soul tonight and always. It is an honor to stand with you. You are respected and loved. Forever yours AK.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see all of the outfits Keys wore during the 62nd annual Grammy awards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvGq5impamoenN8kWlkmqSZmLaiecqesKxlZWK8tsDFoqtmm5iWu6ix0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

After getting married in 1986, the actor and professional tennis player were just about the hottest couple around. But, like many Hollywood romances, it didn't last. Despite having three children together, purchasing multiple homes, and being married for six years, <strong>McEnroe and O'Neal divorced in 1992</strong>. The result was the seven-time Grand Slam champion forking over an absolute fortune to the daughter of Ryan O'Neal.</p><p>Weirdly, Tatum O'Neal's then notable net worth seemingly vanished into thin air. This article will delve into<strong> how much McEnroe paid O'Neal in the divorce settlement </strong>and how her net worth has changed drastically since. Then we will dive into the addiction issues that may have led to her financial collapse. Finally, we will reveal what O'Neal said about divorcing McEnroe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-tatum-o-39-neal-and-john-mcenroe-39-s-divorce-settlement-impacted-their-net-worths>Inside Tatum O'Neal And John McEnroe's Divorce Settlement Impacted Their Net Worths</h2><p>Before marrying tennis pro-John McEnroe, <a href=#>Tatum O'Neal's path to fortune and fame as an actress seemed to be paved from an early age</a>. This started with her debut film, 1973's Paper Moon, alongside her father, Ryan O'Neal. There's no doubt that O'Neal was financially stable, albeit not as wealthy as her first and only husband, John McEnroe. According to Tennis36.com, <strong>the professional athlete has amassed $100 million </strong>over the course of his epic career. This is as opposed to <strong>Tatum O'Neal who is currently worth $1.5 million</strong>, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>However, <strong>O'Neal was awarded a whopping $4.5 million as part of her divorce settlement.</strong> But while she was significantly richer after her divorce, that money has vanished in recent years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/untitled-design-7.png><p>Part of the reason for Tatum O'Neal's financial decline may have something to do with the details of her divorce from McEnroe.<strong> Her career saw a steady decline after divorcing John McEnroe.</strong> According to Celebrity Net Worth, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tatum became addicted to heroin after the divorce</a></strong>. This was one of the reasons why custody of their three children was awarded to McEnroe. It could also be the leading cause of her stagnant net worth.</p><p>However, while this was the case for Tatum O'Neal, during their divorce she also <strong>accused John McEnroe of using drugs</strong>. According to Entertainment Weekly, this claim immediately caught the attention of fans and the media. However, in the end, she proved to be the one struggling with substance addiction. And it is likely why her career dried up and her net worth vanished.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ryan-o-neal-s-violent-altercation-with-his-son-griffin-was-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-in-their-complicated.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ryan O'Neal's Violent Altercation With His Son Griffin Was Just The Tip Of The Iceberg In Their Complicated Relationship</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ryan O'Neal and his eldest son Griffin were wrapped up in several incidents that rocked their relationship forever.</span><p><strong>Tatum O'Neal's highest-paid salary was $350,000</strong> plus nine percent of the profits of The Bad News Bears. This was once considered an absolute fortune. She also received $16,000 for the role in her debut film, Paper Moon. While she has many other acting credits to her name, information about the salaries she was paid is limited. Still, it is enough to warrant a larger net worth than $1.5 million. Especially when her $4.5 million divorce settlement is factored in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-1.jpg><p>However, post-divorce, O'Neal has taken a few small-scale acting jobs.

In 2004, she released an autobiographical book entitled "A Paper Life," which highlighted sensitive aspects of her childhood, such as her mother's addictions, <a href=#>the physical and emotional abuse of her father</a>, and her nasty divorce from McEnroe. The truth was that <strong>O'Neal was already a full-blown addict from her teenage years</strong>, and it seemed to only get worse with time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/untitled-design-8.png><p>It appears as though John McEnroe and Tatum O'Neal's relationship was also founded on drug abuse. According to Daily Mail<strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McEnroe confessed to being on drugs with Tatum</a> </strong>in an autobiography. He said the following:</p><p>"The first time Tatum and I made love, we were high and it was terrible.

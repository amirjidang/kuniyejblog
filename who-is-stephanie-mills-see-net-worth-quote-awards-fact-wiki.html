The song she performed in the musical called “Home” went on to become a hit and solidified Stephanie’s music career. She’s taken various opportunities during her music career that have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Stephanie Mills? As of early-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $1.5 million, mostly accumulated through the success of her music and Broadway career. She’s released many albums that have helped raise and maintain her wealth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=stephanie-mills-net-worth-15-million></span>Stephanie Mills Net Worth $1.5 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Stephanie’s path in music began at a very young age, when she started singing gospel music at the Cornerstone Baptist Church in Brooklyn. Soon her musical prowess would lead her to the stage in Broadway productions, earning a spot in “Maggie Flynn” at the age of nine. Two years later she won a competition in the Apollo Theater which led to her becoming the opening act for the Isley Brothers. In 1973, Mills signed with Paramount Records to do a song, and then later moved to Motown, however, she released a couple of albums that proved unsuccessful, and she was released by the company.</p><p>Her career breakthrough would come in the 1970s when she was cast in the Broadway Musical “The Wiz” which was an African-American rendition of the famous “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”. She became associated with the hit song “Home”, which helped catapult her music career forward. She signed with 20th Century Fox Records and focused on making disco music. She released the album “What Cha’ Gonna do with My Lovin’” which became a gold record, then releasing another album “Sweet Sensation” which spawned a few hits like “Never Knew Love like This Before”. The following year she released “Stephanie”, and two years later “Merciless”, which included the hit song “Pilot Error”, and the cover of Prince’s “How Come You Don’t Call Me Anymore?” She returned for a revival tour of “The Wiz” which was unfortunately short-lived.</p><p>By 1987, Mills had signed with MCA Records and produced the platinum selling “If I Were Your Woman”, which included numerous hit songs. Her following album in 1989, entitled “Home”, became another platinum seller. She’d continue her contract with MCA until 1992 when she was eventually released. After MCA, she tried once again to go on a tour of “The Wiz” which was again short lived. She released a few more songs and albums after that, appearing in various shows and events to sing. In recent events, Stephanie was cast as Aunt Em for the NBC production of “The Wiz”, making it a good 40 years since her first appearance in the production.</p><p>In her personal life, Stephanie was married to singer Jeffrey Daniel for two years during the 1980s, then to Dino Meminger in the late 1980s. In 1993 she married Michael Saunders, a radio program manager, which also lasted just two years. Mills also has a child, a son who was diagnosed with Down Syndrome.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Stephanie Mills</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.5

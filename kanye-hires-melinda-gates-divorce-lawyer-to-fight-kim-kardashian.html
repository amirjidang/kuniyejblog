"<a href=#>I've asked my team</a> to expedite the dissolution of my marriage to Kim so I can put my entire attention to our beautiful children,” the fashion designer said in a statement.</p><p>However, Kim and her family have continued to be the subject of Ye’s notorious social media rants. He’s accused Kim of keeping him from their four kids as well as criticized her parenting.</p><p>During her 9-month relationship with Pete Davidson (which ended last month), Kanye also called him out online. The rapper went so far as to encourage his followers to harass the comedian in-person and released an animated music video for his song “Eazy” depicting him burying Pete alive.</p><p>It's since been reported that <a href=#>Pete entered trauma therapy</a> to process Kanye’s harassment.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Shakira To Stand Trial Over Tax Fraud, Facing $26 Million Fine & Jail Time</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4orrYnmShoaKawG65xKWgp5yRYrSiwMSsZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMpZiwsZWnerW7jJ%2BgoKCkYriquYykmKuckai1qq3NaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

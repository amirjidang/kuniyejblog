Dixie is one of the most followed creators on the app, with 57.1 million followers. Thanks to this and her music career, <a href=#>Dixie has amassed a net worth of $10 million</a>. Meanwhile, Addison Rae has over 87 million followers on TikTok and <a href=#>worked hard to build up her $5 million net worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no doubt that both of them have a lot in common as social media stars. However, due to the constant drama between the queens of TikTok, people doubt if they are still friends. Fans of the pair seem to think that <a href=#>Addison and Dixie might have been secretly feuding for a while</a> because of a leaked track where Dixie sings about a former friend who she deems a "copy and paste" version of herself based on the lyrics. Is Dixie's leaked track about Rae? Do Addison and Dixie actually get along? Keep reading to find out.</p><h2 id=does-dixie-d-39-amelio-like-addison-rae>Does Dixie D'Amelio Like Addison Rae?</h2><p>The song titled Fake is an unreleased demo that Dixie recorded, and when the internet got its hand on it, the fan theories ran wild. On the track, Dixie sings lyrics such as "We were best friends 'til I got a boyfriend. But I still see you every other weekend showin' off your brand new car and that Prada purse. I'll admit it, I like it 'cause I bought them first, yeah." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The song continues to throw shade at a former friend of Dixie</a> and even goes so far as to accuse this former friend of being incredibly fake and trying to steal and copy her whole life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once fans heard the song and read its lyrics, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they became convinced it was a diss track written about Addison</a>. To add further fuel to the speculation fire, fans of the pair combined the song's intro and played it under photos of Dixie and Addison together, highlighting pictures that seemed to track with the whole "copy and paste" lyrics of the song.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Dixie D'Amelio’s Dating Life Before Noah Beck</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The theories continued to run wild until Dixie herself felt compelled to speak out and clear the air about the song, how it came to be, and what it's really about. She took to her backup Instagram account, @mydixiewreckd, to say, "This was a pitch song (a song to be given to someone else) that I just did a demo for. Not about me or for me. Not about anyone else, the theme was a friendship breakup and was not directed at ANYONE."</p><h2 id=dixie-d-39-amelio-39-s-leaked-song-39-fake-39-isn-39-t-about-addison-rae>Dixie D'Amelio's Leaked Song 'Fake' Isn't About Addison Rae</h2><p>According to D'Amelio, someone else wrote the song, brought it to her, and Dixie just sang it as a demo. The TikTok star finished her comments by stating, "This is all I'm gonna say about it because I don't want any more rumors being spread of people putting pictures to a song that I just recorded a demo for. (This was also recorded last May, and I never heard anything about it since.)." So the rumors of a rift between the pair are wildly exaggerated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Dixie spoke out to clear everything up, the fans who had posted those compilation videos with the song have since deleted their videos. While fans have listened to Dixie's comments and gone on to delete their posts, they are now insisting that Dixie do something else that they want: To re-record the song and officially release it, so they can listen to it properly and not play the leaked version of the track. Their followers are glad that all's well with Dixie and Addison as they begin to find a lot more success in their respective blossoming music and business careers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All Of Addison Rae's Achievements In 2021, Explained</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-addison-rae-still-friends-with-charli-d-39-amelio>Is Addison Rae Still Friends With Charli D'Amelio?</h2><p>Are the queens of TikTok feuding? Recent social media activity suggests that Charli D'Amelio and Addison Rae could be on the outs. A couple of months ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eagle-eyed fans noticed that Charli had unfollowed Addison on Instagram</a>. The news had everyone assuming there was some serious Bad Blood between the pair. With the recent leak of a diss track demo that Charli's older sister, Dixie D'Amelio, recorded called Fake about some intense friendship drama, the hypothesis that Charli could be fighting with Addison isn't precisely unfounded.</p><p>Mainly because once fans noticed what was going down, Addison happened to tweet out a broken-heart emoji, which they speculated could be about Charli unfollowing Addison. One fan responded to the tweet by asking, "if it's because of Charli's unfollow, I just hope everything is fine between you guys." Even though Addison never clarified her tweet, fans can rest easy because it seems like the drama between the pair is the only fake thing happening here. The truth is that Addison isn't the only person Charli unfollowed. She wiped her entire Instagram clean by deleting all photos and her profile picture. Charli took to Twitter in a series of now-deleted posts to clear the air. She explained, "I want to unfollow everyone on Instagram and start over."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Crazy Ways Charli D’Amelio Spends Her Massive Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dmba5tcRmm5qllaG2sHnAp5tmmZSZtrS7zWapmp1dqMGquMtmnauhlaOxtHmRaWlrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

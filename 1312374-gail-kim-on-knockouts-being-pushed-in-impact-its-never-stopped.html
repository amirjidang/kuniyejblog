Since then, IMPACT Wrestling elevated its Knockouts division with all-women’s events, first-ever matches, and high-caliber competition with the best in the game. Kim, one of the game changers in IMPACT’s history, now serves as a producer for the Knockouts. In speaking with <a href=#>Steve Fall of NBC Sports Boston</a>, Gail Kim spoke about the women’s division getting the respect they rightfully earned in a male-dominated industry.</p><p>“I guess if you’re going to look at it in a mainstream perspective in terms of casual fans, they may not know [the history], but I definitely feel like we get the respect from within the industry, from the very hardcore, loyal fans who have been watching wrestling of all types, every company across the board for years. I feel like we get a lot of respect and the props for that, and I appreciate it,” Kim explained.</p><p>“Listen, I’m just happy that it happened, to be honest,” she admitted. “I’m happy we [Kim and Awesome Kong] got the opportunity that we did that they brought in that title and ten girls in 2007 when nothing was happening for women’s wrestling. The fact that TNA got behind that, Jeff Jarrett, Dixie Carter at that time gave us that chance. That’s all I wanted. And then it was up to us to carry that ball and run with it. Right? And it was just a magical chemistry with me and Awesome Kong and will forever be grateful for that.”</p><p>Kim went on to also praise the booking of the ever-expanding Knockouts division.</p><p>“The company has been nothing but consistent in terms of pushing the women, giving them opportunities. Since 2007, it’s never stopped and 2022 is no exception. We have about 20 girls on the roster. They all have a prominent role on the show or have some type of role in the show. I think that’s important because when people are valued and used in the show, it’s less cutthroat, I guess you could say in a sense. People really support each other in terms of just creating the best match possible, giving their all to be the best in order to show that they have a platform to shine, basically.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJqaWxvZGK0orXLZqKipV2ku263zaiapKelqcBursSipaBloKrAqbHDZqCnZZmivaKv02agratdo7K3sdFmqq2noKWypQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

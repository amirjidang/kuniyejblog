THAT is why you go to fashion shows, people. There‚Äôs an endless stream of free booze and bite-sized food called canap√©s, which I still think is a name the French made up for under-catering events. My parents always told me there is safety in numbers, so I wasted no time befriending two lovely ladies from Texas who were also in town for the event and similarly displeased (as I‚Äôd expect for Texans) by the tiny food portions. Those poor waiters started avoiding our table after we‚Äôd wipe a tray clean! The goat‚Äôs cheese tartlets didn‚Äôt stand a chance. In classic style of the character I play in my own life, I start knocking back glasses of champagne. One‚Ä¶two‚Ä¶.three‚Ä¶MORE! In a room full of sexy people and six foot something models, I find comfort in knowing champagne gets you drunk faster (its a fact, according to a quick google search). And google never lies more than the guys I date, so? Somewhere approaching 10:00pm he finds me. In a sea of beautiful people just standing there *being* beautiful, I‚Äôm the girl falling over herself telling a story to my new friends from Texas. But I‚Äôm not just telling a story, I‚Äôm re-enacting it. With hand gestures. With full body movements. All of my limbs‚Ä¶ all of the volume! ‚ÄúThere you are‚Äù he spoke softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for you all night‚Äù. He has? ‚ÄúYou have?‚Äù I respond. ‚ÄúBut of course!‚Äù He says with a grin. Ahh, the Spanish. They find a way to make something so ordinary sound like as if it were a romance novel coming to life. ‚ÄúWould you like to dance?‚Äù He asks rhetorically with his hand already extended, ready to take mine. I do a quick scout of the crowd around me, who I‚Äôm sure I haven‚Äôt seen dancing all night. But in that moment of quickly turning, the room is suddenly turning with me, spinning, and without intending to, I‚Äôm half way to the floor when he catches me.

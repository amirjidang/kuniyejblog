The bauble is a nod to Travis’ number on the team, and according to creator <strong>Emily Bordner</strong>, it came from Donna, 71.</p><p>“We gifted Donna some [styles]. We know that she loved our earrings,” Bordner, who owns EB and Co. in Kansas City’s Brookside neighborhood, told <a href=# rel=noopener>KMBC News</a> on Monday, January 29.</p><p>Bordner, who also serves as the store’s creative director, explained that her team “wanted to gift” Donna “even more Kelce-themed products” from their new Chiefs collection, which is when they shipped her the ring. “We were hoping that she would give them to Taylor. And she did,” Bordner told the outlet, noting that once Swift was seen with the ring, the item sold out immediately.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Travis-Kelce-s-Mom-Donna-Kelce-Gifted-Taylor-Swift-Her-87-Jersey-Ring-Says-Designer-feature.jpg><p>“It was just absolute chaos, but it was very exciting,” she added, revealing that fans can <a href=# rel=noopener>preorder the Travis ring</a> and a similar <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong> jersey accessory online. “So, this is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime thing.”</p><p>Swift wore the “87” jersey ring on her right pointer finger while in Baltimore on Sunday. She also donned a red and gold “Heirloom Signet Ring” by Mejuri on her left middle finger as a nod to the team’s colors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Travis-Kelce-with-Taylor-Swift-608.jpg><p>The “Karma” singer topped off her look with a gold pendant necklace created by BaubleBar and WEAR by Erin Andrews with the Chiefs’ logo engraved on it. Fans noticed a “TNT” yellow gold bracelet on Swift’s wrist, which some speculate is a nickname for the couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Travis-Kelce-s-Mom-Donna-Kelce-Gifted-Taylor-Swift-Her-87-Jersey-Ring-Says-Designer-2.png><p>Swift has been <a href=#>upping her game day gear</a> since attending her first Chiefs game in September 2023, confirming <a href=#>her and Travis’ relationship</a> after months of speculation.

The Chiefs’ win landed the team a spot in Super Bowl LVIII, which takes place in Las Vegas on Sunday, February 11.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After the win, <a href=#>Swift was seen with Travis’ mom</a>, dad <strong>Ed Kelce</strong>, and brother <strong>Jason Kelce</strong> on the field as they celebrated the team’s advancement to the big game. Swift was photographed giving her boyfriend a kiss before seemingly <a href=#>dropping the “L” word</a>.</p><p>“What’s up sweetie?” Travis said in a video shared via X on Sunday. It appeared that Swift replied, “I’ve never seen you like that,” while hugging the tight end. Later in the video, Swift seemingly mouthed, “I love you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5m8r7rAZqKepJOaeqi1xa2cnWWklsatu9FmqrChlql6qbHRZm9wZZqav7Sx2GapoqaXYsCixdJmm56rmZy7pr6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Camila Cabello's gorgeous four-bedroom, four-bathroom property situated above the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles has found a buyer for $3.95 million. Denise Rosner, a Compass agent, advertised the residence, which the performer had indeed evacuated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Scott Moore of Douglas Ellman represented the buyer. The 3,570-square-foot house is situated on a 6,320-square-foot (0.15-acre) plot. The Moroccan renaissance property features a private courtyard entry and a partitioned open floor layout with weathered wood flooring combined with import tiling. The house has a modern kitchen accented with stainless steel equipment and stone surfaces, as well as a breakfast bar that links to the dining area, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mansion Global</a>.</p><p>The lounge room has a Spanish tiles fireplace and an additional lounge space, while the two above levels include three en-suite rooms. <a href=#>The master bedroom has a fireplace</a> and a huge walk-in closet, whereas the big master retreat also has a fireplace and a huge walk-in closet. Cabello transformed the fourth bedroom into a state-of-the-art recording studio inside the adjacent two-car garage, complete with a professional vocal booth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The outside amenities include a multi-level deck with a saline pool, an outdoor terrace eating area, several lounging places, a wood-burning fireplace, and a recently constructed BBQ area. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, the house also has an additional security system, which was built when Cabello's ex-boyfriend, singer Shawn, had his new G-Wagon stolen from the driveway when they both were at home in March.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Moore stated that the buyer visited 40 to 50 houses before settling on Ms. Cabello's. "Of most of the places we looked at, well, this spoke with us the strongest," he added. "In comparison to everything else we viewed, the character, charm, and vitality of the residence stole the show here."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>'13 Reasons Why' Star Devin Druid Sells His First House For $1.4 Million</a></span></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mansion Global</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwornIpZhmm5GXsq24zmaqnqScqHqpsdFmqqmqkay5qrrGZp%2BopJyuxLC7w2afoqScqHqurc2soKimXZu8s3mTZmpmpZmhuaq7zWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

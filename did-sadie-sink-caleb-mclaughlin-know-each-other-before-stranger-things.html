Like many child stars, both Caleb and Sadie began their careers on Broadway and came to the show with both talent and experience.While Caleb was cast prior to season one as Lucas Sinclair one of the four original members of The Party, Sadie tagged along in season two as Max Mayfield. The young characters have not only been through the trials and tribulations of the Upside Down, but they also loved and lost in their whirlwind romance that has spanned and changed over three seasons.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Details From Stranger Things That Make Zero Sense</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sadie-and-caleb-were-both-broadway-performers>Sadie And Caleb Were Both Broadway Performers</h2><p>Even though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the cast of Stranger Things has no shortage of musical talent</a>, both Sadie and Caleb bring another layer of perfection altogether. Sadie got her start in 2013, at age 11 when she portrayed Annie, the show's main character.</p><p>Sadie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was deemed a "triple-threat talent</a>", as she alternated with co-star Lilla Crawford and earned the professionalism that she took with her onto the set of Stranger Things 2.</p><p>As Sadie was just stepping into the spotlight in 2013, Caleb already had a year under his belt. From 2012 until 2014, he portrayed Young Simba in the Broadway rendition of The Lion King, Caleb even commemorates his time on Broadway almost every year with a picture of himself in his nearly-completed costume.</p><p>He thanks the cast and crew of the show and even credits them for giving him the leg-up necessary to take the next steps in his acting career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although not in the same play, Sadie and Caleb were among some of the youngest Broadway members at the time.

Upon joining the cast, Sadie and Caleb continued to mesh well together both on and off-screen.</p><p>Since transitioning from the stage to the screen, both Sadie and Caleb have starred in several projects. Most recently, <a href=#>Sadie took center stage in Netflix's Fear Street film trilogy</a> in 2021. After working on Stranger Things for some time before her casting, she was well-conditioned for the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All the while, Caleb <a href=#>starred alongside Idris Elba in another Netflix production entitled Concrete Cowboys</a> in 2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Movies To Watch If You Love Stranger Things</a></span></p><p>Though their credits are still few at the moment, this is the beginning of great things for the young actors</p><h2 id=auditions-for-stranger-things-were-intense>Auditions For Stranger Things Were Intense</h2><p>Like many Netflix shows, being cast on Stranger Things was not an easy feat. The Duffer Brothers Matt and Ross had the show planned out to a T and were incredibly picky about who would take on the starring roles. âââââââ</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">At least 10 actors were rejected from a number of roles</a>, from Will (Noah Schnapp) to his eccentric mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder).

However, this does not mean that either of them is looking to make Broadway their home once again. After spending so much time in front of a camera as opposed to a live audience, the two seem to be enjoying their change of pace.</p><p>Though Broadway appears to be off the table, music is not. One of Sadie's latest roles had her <a href=#>alongside Dylan O'Brien in Taylor Swift's short film for her song "All Too Well."</a> On the other hand, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caleb told BET back in 2021 that he was slowly but surely getting back into music</a> after the release of his 2021 single, "Neighborhood."</p><p>So while fans can look forward to once again seeing the latest dynamic duo on the screen for what is said to be the show's 5th and final season of Stranger Things they can dive into new music, shows, and movies from them.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Who Are The Duffer Brothers?

"Mills originally sought $250 million of Macca’s supposed $1.6 billion fortune, but the judge in the case ruled the McCartney’s total assets were only worth $800 million. In addition to today’s ruling, McCartney will also have to pay $70,000 a year in alimony for the couple’s four-year-old daughter, as well as school and nanny fees."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mills said of the outcome, “I’m so glad it’s over,” said Mills. “It was an incredible result in the end to secure mine and my daughter’s future and that of all the charities that I obviously plan on helping and making a difference with — because you know it has been my life for twenty years.”</p><p>As for McCartney, although it was a blow, the artist had a deal in place at the time worth $400 million alongside Apple and iTunes to release a digital version of The Beatles catalog. Not a bad trade-off...</p><p>As for recent times, <a href=#>McCartney made $1.6 million thanks to an investment</a> in a plant-based chicken company.

Parson's adult Sheldon has only previously appeared in Young Sheldon as a voiced narrator. Their on-screen cameo wasn't just to please fans, it also allowed fans to get an update on their favorite characters.</p><p>Fans think that Amy and Sheldon's appearance hinted at a darker fate for Leonard, who did not appear in the finale episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following, we discuss why fans think Leonard is dead after The Big Bang Theory and how Johnny Galecki's character's health issues help this theory. We also take a look back at how Johnny Galecki felt about The Big Bang Theory coming to an end after 12 seasons.</p><h2 id=why-fans-think-leonard-died-after-the-big-bang-theory-finale>Why Fans Think Leonard Died After The Big Bang Theory Finale</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/young-sheldon-finale.jpg><p>Sheldon and Amy are the only The Big Bang Theory characters to appear in the Young Sheldon finale, but there were a few hints which led fans to believe<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Leonard passed away after the events of the original series.</a></p><p><strong>The couple revealed their son was called Leonard,</strong> which was previously confirmed in an earlier episode of Young Sheldon from season four. Their firstborn's name was inspired by Sheldon's love for both Leonard Hofstadter and Leonard Nimoy. Sheldon isn't the kindest and most sentimental to his friends, leading fans to wonder if he named his son after his deceased friend and housemate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/george-cooper-s-unavoidable-death-becomes-even-more-tragic-after-young-sheldon-season-7-episode-12-promo-clip.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="George Cooper's Unavoidable Death Becomes Even More Tragic After Young Sheldon Season 7, Episode 12 Clip">George Cooper's Unavoidable Death Becomes Even More Tragic After Young Sheldon Season 7, Episode 12 Clip</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Young Sheldon fans know George Cooper's death is coming, but they never expected this to happen first.</p><p>Another reason fans think Leonard died is because <strong>the couple mentioned his wife and not him</strong>. As Amy and Sheldon walk out of his office to attend their son's Leonard's hockey game in Pasadena. Amy adds that their daughter wants to become an actress, to which Sheldon comments was due to Penny babysitting her. It seems odd that Penny is mentioned, but Leonard is not, especially as the couple got married on the show.</p><p>Leonard's lack of appearance in Young Sheldon was explained by producer Steve Holland, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't want The Big Bang Theory characters to overshadow </a>the prequel show's ending.</p><p>“We didn’t want to go with the whole cast. And we also wanted to keep it on Sheldon and Amy and their kids’ relationship, so it just seemed like a nice coda at the end. And the Sheldon-Penny relationship was always so strong on Big Bang, it seemed like a nice way to do it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the producers admit they hid lots of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Easter eggs for fans of the show</a>, so it's likely they knew that people would pick up on the lack of Leonard being mentioned. "We didn’t want it to distract from the scene that’s going on but maybe if people go back and freeze-frame afterwards, there’s a lot of little hidden things decorating that set."</p><p>"It was really fun and emotional, actually, to pull those things back into our world.”"</p><h2 id=leonard-suffered-from-health-issues-throughout-the-big-bang-theory>Leonard Suffered From Health Issues Throughout The Big Bang Theory</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Penny-and-Leonard-TBBT.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonard suffered a range of well-established health issues</a> </strong>through the 12 seasons of The Big Bang Theory.</p><p>The Big Bang Theory's Leonard Hofstadter's health issues include:</p><ul><li>Lactose intolerant</li><li>Asthmatic</li><li>Wears glasses due to myopia</li><li>Suffers from carsickness</li><li>Suffers from migraines</li><li>Has sleep apnea</li><li>Gets a nosebleed when he goes jogging</li></ul><p>He frequently talks about his many allergies, but one of his main health issues is his lactose intolerance. He avoids most of the food at The Cheesecake Factory, where Penny works in earlier episodes of the show. He avoids all the desserts for the fear his intestines will blow up like a balloon animal and cause the emission of a noxious gas that Sheldon fears could be weaponized.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ttweb_big-bang-theory-s-lowest-rated-episode-made-leonard-s-mistreatment-of-penny-painfully-obvious_bk_a1_v2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Big Bang Theory's Lowest-Rated Episode Made Leonard's Mistreatment Of Penny Painfully Obvious">Big Bang Theory's Lowest-Rated Episode Made Leonard's Mistreatment Of Penny Painfully Obvious</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The way Leonard treats Penny in Big Bang Theory season 10, episode 22 has a lot to do with why it's the series' lowest-rated episode.</p><p><strong>He also talks about being prone to heart disease and ear infections</strong>. His predisposition to heart issues may have caused his untimely death.</p><p>Sometimes, these many illnesses cause plot holes and inconsistencies.

We were just blindsided that day. And not necessarily shocked by Jim's decision, but that he hadn't had that conversation with his castmates first to prepare us.

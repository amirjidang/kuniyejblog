The conversation revealed the Brooklyn rapper inked a contract with <a href=# id=auto-tag_mase data-tag=mase>Mase</a>‘s RichFish label and received a $5,000 advance. He described how he “just signed the sh*t, immediately,” without a lawyer present back in 2019.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The ni**a&nbsp;that brought me to him, he was like, ‘Yo, man. Just sign that sh*t, You buggin,’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, read it.’ He’s like, ‘Alright, just sign it. It’s good.’ So, I just signed it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Meek-Mill-Fivio-Foreign.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued to discuss receiving the $5,000 advance, to the confusion of the podcast hosts. The “Big Drip” rapper explained how he picks up on insider knowledge from Mase, seeming content with the deal.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I thought that sh*t was going to last until whenever it was going to last. That sh*t ain’t last two weeks,” detailed Fivio.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I don’t really be complaining or&nbsp;crying over spilled milk,” he continued. “I already made this decision. For me, I’m in a better situation now. He get what he get…But I control my money.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Back in 2020, 50 Cent was a guest on Rap Radar’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Cigar Talk</a> and claimed Mase was practicing the same predatory behavior that pushed him away from Diddy. After 50 Cent’s allegations, Naji, the host of the digital platform spoke with Mase who provided details on the deal.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“PSA: I spoke to Mase today. He called me & showed me paperwork saying he took 0% of Fivio Foreign’s publishing rights,” Naji tweeted. “Fivio & Mase do have an existing agreement which I won’t disclose. But, we will have clarity soon, on a lot of issues.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At the time, Fivio himself also went on Hot 97 and clarified the situation with Pete Rosenburg. “So it was a production deal… He don’t own none of my publishing,” he <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>explained.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Fivio Foreign’s full conversation on the Million Dollaz Worth Of Game podcast on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5u2t7XOZp2oqpWetK95w56YpWWdlsCmeZRpZ2llkZnDorrCnmRqamNpg3l9kGtnaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

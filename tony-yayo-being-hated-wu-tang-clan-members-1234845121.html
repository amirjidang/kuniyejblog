The <a href=#>G-Unit member</a> spoke about being hated by the legendary group in a recent interview.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Yayo appeared on <a href=#>Vlad TV</a> once again on Wednesday (Jan. 24) and discussed his feelings on the Wu. “I love Wu-Tang, even though some of y’all hate me,” he said. “But I love you guys.” He shared an old story about how he would listen to their classic record “C.R.E.A.M.” while he was selling drugs in the 90s.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “So Seductive” artist’s feelings may stem from some comments he made about <a href=#>Ghostface Killah</a> in 2007. “He didn’t even write that album, man,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow>SPIN</a>, referring to the 2000 classic <a href=#>Supreme Clientele</a>. “He didn’t write it. That kid from Far Rockaway — Superb — he wrote that record. You know Superb from Far Rock?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ghostface Killah responded to the allegations in a conversation with Rhapsody, saying, “I was in Europe when I heard [Tony Yayo say] that. That’s just nonsense. I still put mad sh*t out.” Superb, a member of Raekwon’s group American Dream Team, claimed to write for Ghost at one point; Tony Starks denied the claim and told Tony Yayo to “suck [his] d**k.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Killah also addressed Superb in his conversation with Rhapsody. “Perb was Perb, Ghost was Ghost,” he said. “Perb is Rae’s man. He been in the studio a few times while we’re doing sh*t. He ain’t write sh*t. All Perb contributed was a couple of lines that you could put in the air. When we write, we all do that. Say ‘this one right here’ or ‘Put this one right here.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In a 2009 interview with <a rel=nofollow href=#>XXL</a>, he revealed that he and <a href=#>50 Cent</a> were on good terms following tension sparked from “How To Rob;” notably, he never mentioned Yayo. “That’s some old-school sh*t,” he said. “Back then, things were all snowballed in the air on some other sh*t. I didn’t like what he said, that’s where it all started from anyway. But we kicked it on the phone one time, and after we kicked it on the phone that was it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8r8WMspiyp12Xsqq6xmafmqyVmXq4wYytmKefXZi5orqMppymmpWnwG59kWxrcWxlZn9yew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

In <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2003</a>, for example, she chose this green gown for the event, and she looked fabulous. Tom Ford designed the dress for Yves Saint Laurent, and the contrast of the green with her skin was a perfect choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was also a significant moment in her career. That year, she received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work in The Hours and a Best Actress nomination for her role in Far from Heaven praised by the critics. Although she went dressed to win, the actress had to wait some years to bring an Oscar statue back home with her.</p><h2 id=oscar-1998>Oscar 1998</h2><p>When we look at our pictures from the '90s, there are lots of regrets about our fashion choices. But not if you are <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Juliane Moore</a>. This all-white look is proof that the actress doesn't make a mistake on the red carpet. No wonder she became a fashion icon!&nbsp;She could even make minor changes and use it again in 2020. Perhaps if she changes the shoes, bag, and letting the scarf go, it would be still looking great in another red carpet. But it is also impressive how she hardly changed throughout the years.</p><p>Back in the '90s, Moore was already one of the most prominent names in the film industry, and it was easy to forecast she would have a brilliant career ahead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oscar-2010>Oscar 2010</h2><p>Julianne Moore doesn't need much to steal the spotlight, and it seems she is aware of that. She appeared on the Academy Awards Ceremony wearing a shining dress by Calvin Klein, matching it with a jade ring and diamond bracelets. Although it looks simple, it is easy to make this dress look "too much" by choosing the wrong jewelry and accessories. But Moore hardly makes a mistake in the red carpet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>5 Best Oscars Hosts Ever (& 5 Worst)</a></span></p><p>Once again, she makes looking fabulous look so simple!

In 2015, <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julianne Moore</a> attended the event wearing a red peplum Prabal Gurung and a skirt of the same color. Although it is not a gown and this luncheon is not so glamorous as the award ceremony, the actress looked super elegant, and it is another excellent look that deserves to be on this list. And it was just a warm-up for what she would wear that year.</p><h2 id=oscar-2000>Oscar 2000</h2><p>In 2000, Juliane Moore received a Best Actress nomination for her role at The End Of The Affair, and her look that night deserved an Oscar itself. Once again, it is a dress that she could wear today, and we would still rank her as one of the best-dressed people of the night.

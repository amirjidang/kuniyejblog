Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban were having a whole jealousy debacle when a female singer opened for a Keith Urban show. Although the facts had been smudged, he and the female singer had nothing going on and the rumor was started by a gossip website.</p><p>One month later Kieth supposedly was jealous of Nicole Kidman being too close to one of her costars. This was also rubbish and was started by a gossip website. There were many cases of gossip websites starting rumors, but the couple trusted each other and knew that they could handle websites lying about them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-kieth-urban-stopped-drinking-for-her>When Kieth Urban Stopped Drinking For Her</h2><p>Keith Urban stopped drinking the year him and Nicole Kidman got married.

They certainly avoid posting photos of their daughters online and don't cause big scenes as most celebrities do. They stay humble and save those photos for special occasions. One of those occasions was their daughter’s Sunday's birthday. She turned 11 in July, and to celebrate they visited Paris and posted a photo of their daughters looking out of a clocktower over the city.</p><p>Besides the occasional paparazzi photo, this is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a rare photo</a> of the family being posted online for the public to see. They keep their children out of the limelight, allowing them to live normal lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-nickname-for-him>Her Nickname For Him</h2><p>Cute nicknames are vital to relationships, maybe not vital, but everyone has heard one before. They are a name that is only used for that significant other who means so much to you, that calling them by their actual name just isn't acceptable. Nicole Kidman has a great nickname for Kieth Urban. She calls him her Aussie Beach Boy, which is extremely fitting. She calls him that because the two times he's his hottest is when he's on the beach or when he's playing guitar, according to her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Guys Who Were Lucky Enough to Date Kaley Cuoco</a></span></p><p>Telling the public about her nickname for Kieth just goes to show how down-to-earth Nicole is about expressing love for her husband.</p><h2 id=keith-urban-s-celebration-after-winning-awards>Keith Urban’s Celebration After Winning Awards</h2><p>Keith Urban took home Entertainer of the Year at the <i>CMA Awards</i>, and after he was announced winner he celebrated by planting a giant kiss on Nicole Kidman.

He gave Nicole Kidman a long, giant kiss, and then ran over and hugged the other nominees.</p><h2 id=keith-urban-s-description-of-nicole-kidman>Keith Urban’s description of Nicole Kidman</h2><p>Everyone has a way to describe their significant other in one sentence, but would rather not share it with the entire world. Keith Urban released a track called “Gemini” in which he said that sentence loud and clear. Describing Nicole Kidman as a maniac in the bed, but a brainiac in the head, he stirred up some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversy</a> in the news.</p><p>At 52, Nicole Kidman couldn't help but laugh and tell the media that she doesn't censor his music, and would rather be complimented than be called boring. Although there were some other scandalous revealing lines in the album, she wouldn't comment.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Times Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone Were Relationship Goals</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nnp6wsLjEZqKinJ2Wu263xKKroWWlp6%2BiuoyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmn5%2BWubR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

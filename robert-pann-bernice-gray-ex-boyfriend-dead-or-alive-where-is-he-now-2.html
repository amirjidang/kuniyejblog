But shortly after, she went missing. When Bernice’s manager spotted her disappearance, he informed her ex-boyfriend by phone.</p><p>At that point, Bernice’s family was informed that she was missing and the police were called. Four days after she vanished, her abandoned car was finally found in Detroit, Michigan.</p><p>When the cops arrived, they found blood splatter all over the interior of the vehicle.

Is He Dead Or Alive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bernice Gray’s ex-boyfriend Robert Pann is currently serving out his sentence in Carson City Correctional Facility in Michigan for the murder of Bernice Gray in December 1994. He is still alive and will live out the rest of his days in the facility.</p><p>When Bernice was declared legally dead in January 1995, authorities were finally authorized to open a murder inquiry. They learned that the victim had broken up with her ex-boyfriend Robert Pann not long before the victim was shot.</p><p>In fact, Bernice had apparently rejected Pann’s marriage proposal two days prior to her disappearance and later admitted that he had threatened to kill her.</p><p>A few hours after Bernice was reported missing, Pann returned the engagement ring and asserted that she had passed away. According to the jeweler Pann purchased the ring from, Pann had dirt and grime around his shoes when he returned the ring.</p><p>This further indicates that he might have been attempting to conceal a body.</p><p><strong>Try reading:&nbsp;Who Is Bradley Pen Dragon?

Based on the bullet fragments and quantity of blood in her automobile, the Macomb County medical examiner determined that Gray was murdered.</p><p>On December 26, 1991, at a stop sign on Gordon and Florence, Gray was allegedly shot twice in the head. Police found her purse at 7 pm at Interstate 94 and Chalmers in Detroit.</p><p>Over the following few years, detectives and relatives dug up fields in Macomb County, investigated waterways surrounding Lake St. Clair, and explored sewers and abandoned homes in Detroit.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=insight-on-robert-pann-wiki></span>Insight On Robert Pann Wiki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1996, Robert Pann was found guilty of attempting to kill his ex-wife and received a six-year jail sentence. He was accused of first-degree murder in connection with the passing of Bernice Gray in April 2000.</p><p>In 1991, Pann was held responsible for Gray’s murder and body disposal. After telling police a backhoe he owned went missing in 1993, Pann was accused of making a fraudulent police report.</p><p>Later, at Hoover and Toepfer, the identical backhoe was discovered close to a 17.5-acre site.

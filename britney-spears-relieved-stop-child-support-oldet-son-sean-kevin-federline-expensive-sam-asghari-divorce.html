The pair were married from 2004 to 2007, and K-Fed got primary custody of their boys shortly after their split.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Britney Spears' Family Is “Worried” For Her As She Exhibits Erratic Behavior Amid Sam Asghari Divorce</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Britney is happy to help Sean and Jayden. There is nothing she wouldn't do for her sons. But this would go directly to them after they turn 18 instead of Kevin,” the insider continued, adding Britney thinks “it's time for Kevin to get a job.”</p><h2 id=kevin-almost-got-more-child-support-by-moving-his-family-to-hawaii>Kevin Almost Got More Child Support By Moving His Family To Hawaii</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/untitled-design-49.jpg><p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that Kevin had asked Britney for permission to move their sons to Hawaii, along with his wife and their two younger children. Britney apparently didn’t contest the move. However, there was speculation moving to the tropical state may entitle K-Fed to more money from Britney, since Hawaii is one of few U.S. states with extended child support laws. In some cases, Hawaii can require a parent to pay child support until the offspring is 23.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, as Daily Mail notes, Hawaiian state laws says that if child support was established in another state, that agreement still applies. As such, Britney and Kevin’s agreement falls under Californian jurisdiction, which no longer requires Britney to pay child support once a child turns 18.</p><p>Kevin and Britney’s younger son, Jayden, is 17-years old, so it won’t be long before the pop star is no longer required to pay child support for him, either.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Britney Spears Allegedly Needed Stitches After Huge Fight With Sam Asghari Before He Filed For Divorce</a></span></p><p>It’s not known how much Britney is paying in child support per month. In May of 2018, Kevin Federline made a formal request for an upward adjustment in child support payments for their two sons, seeking an increase of $40,000 per month, raising the total from $20,000 to $60,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Britney’s father and conservator, Jamie Spears, initially opposed Kevin's request. The details of any subsequent changes in the support amount, if any were granted, remain undisclosed as the case was sealed.</p><h2 id=britney-spears-rsquo-divorce-from-sam-asghari-is-getting-expensive>Britney Spears’ Divorce From Sam Asghari Is Getting Expensive</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sam-asghari-s-reaction-revealed-after-britney-spears-dances-with-shirtless-men-during-divorce-party.jpg><p>Britney may no longer have to foot child support, but she’s got a lot of rising legal costs thanks to her divorce from Sam Asghari. It was recently reportedly that the singer <a href=#>agreed to pay her estranged husband’s $10,000 apartment</a> after he moved out of their marital home after filing for divorce on August 16th after 14 months of marriage.</p><p>Moreover, Britney may have to pay a generous divorce settlement to Sam, as <a href=#>various reports say he’s trying to challenge their prenup</a>, though he’s denied the allegations.

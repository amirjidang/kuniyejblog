While she appeared in a few episodes of "That '90s Show" many fans wondered if Prepon was done acting. As it turns out, she has gone to the other side of the camera and is directing episodes of "That '90s Show." Prepon has also taken to using Instagram to show off her cooking and mixology skills with what she is calling #GetYourPrepOn. All of which is being done with <strong>her signature red hair</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laura-prepon-had-a-memorable-audition-for-that-39-70s-show>Laura Prepon Had A Memorable Audition For That '70s Show</h2><h3 id=laura-prepon-embodied-the-character-donna-pinciotti-without-even-knowing-it>Laura Prepon embodied the character Donna Pinciotti without even knowing it</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar41781625-1.jpg><p>The cast of That '70s Show were all extremely young when it made its network TV debut. <a href=#>Mila Kunis lied about her age</a> while Fez was still in high school.</p><p>Nonetheless, they meshed extremely well together, and that included Laura Prepon as Donna. According to the actress, she cemented her position on the show after a memorable last two words.</p><p>"One of the things that's really funny is later after I got on the show, I had said to our creators, Bonnie and Terri Turner, 'What was the thing that made you know that I was Donna?'" she recalls alongside EW.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They said, 'First of all, when you came in, you just were Donna. You were Donna Pinciotti; you were perfect for her.' And at the end of the audition, I looked at them and I said, 'We good?' And I put my hands on the table and I pushed off like a total tomboy. It was just how I got up from my table. They said that sealed the deal."</p><p>Looking back at the earlier seasons, Prepon admitted that it is quite surreal to see how young the cast was at the start, though it didn't feel that way while shooting the series.</p><p>"We were like, I don't know, 20 when we did this scene and we look like little babies. It's so funny how when you are 20 you feel like you know everything."</p><p>The show thrived for several seasons but during the last two, Donna underwent a major transformation, one the show completely ate up.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/filming-the-final-episode-of-that-70s-show-was-a-nightmare-for-laura-prepon.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Amid The Danny Masterson Drama, This Is How Laura Prepon Is Rising Above The Scandal</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Laura Prepon has delighted fans with the lack of drama she engages in, but the actress is staying busy online.</span><h2 id=laura-prepon-had-to-change-her-hair-color-for-the-2006-film-karla>Laura Prepon Had To Change Her Hair Color For The 2006 Film Karla</h2><h3 id=laura-prepon-kept-the-blonde-hair-color-from-klara-because-it-made-for-a-great-that-39-70s-show-storyline>Laura Prepon kept the blonde hair color from Klara because it made for a great That '70s Show storyline</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar49090743-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turned out to be a major storyline on the show, Donna changing hair color from her classic red head look, to blonde. She did so for the film Karla but as it turns out, <strong>the show-runners loved the change in appearance, so much so that she was asked to keep</strong> the look.</p><p>According to IMDb, it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn't the first time the show had input on her hair</a> color. It was the same ordeal at the start of the series.</p><p>"<strong>Laura Prepon is actually a natural brunette</strong>. When she was recruited for the show, she was asked to dye her hair a shade of red for the character Donna. Prepon eventually had to dye her hair blonde for Karla (2006), in which she played the title role."</p><p>"As a result, her character <strong>Donna Pinciotti was written to have changed hair color for the show's final two seasons</strong>. The producers loved her new hair color and begged her to keep it for the show. Prepon had grown to like her blonde hair too and kept the color for years even after the show had finished, but ultimately had to dye her hair black for her show Orange Is the New Black (2013)."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prepon admitted alongside Women's Health that the topic of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hair color was brought up a lot when she turned blonde</a>, stating, "Now that I'm blonde, yeah, totally.

My hair can be any color and I'll always have fun."</p><h2 id=laura-prepon-returned-to-the-that-39-70s-show-set>Laura Prepon Returned To The That '70s Show Set</h2><h3 id=laura-prepon-appeared-in-three-episodes-of-that-39-90s-show>Laura Prepon appeared in three episodes of That '90s Show</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar52347779-1.jpg><p>Laura Prepon appeared on That '90s Show.

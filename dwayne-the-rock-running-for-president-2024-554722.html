But in a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety,</a> he shared that while he’s interested in a political career, 2020 wouldn’t be the right time to do so. Instead, 2024 seems more befitting&nbsp;of his White House aspirations.</p><p>“Realistically, as we go into 2018, when you look at my slate as we’re developing and shooting into 2019 and 2020, the slate goes deep into 2021, so it feels like the realistic consideration would be 2024,” he said.</p><p>“Americans picked it up and there was this sentiment of, ‘We’re not joking, and we would really love the idea if you would run,’” he continued. “In that, I knew I had to listen to the people and really, really think about it. That’s where I’m at right now—I’m well aware politics is not the business I’m in, so the best thing I can do is continuing to listen and learn as much as I can. I’m continuing to watch our presidency and watch how every new development is handled. I continue to watch our leaders in government, and like all Americans, I continue to be hopeful that our leaders exhibit poise, perspective and the ability to bring our country together during these tough times—which I don’t feel our presidency is currently doing—so that’s where I’m at.”</p><p>In addition to denouncing our current president’s inadequacy, he also emphasized all the predatory actions Hollywood executives are being called out on by women who have been victims of sexual misconduct. He admits he’s met some of these men, and at times feels like resorting to physical violence to reprimand them for their unruly behavior. But he refrains from such tactics because he knows, ultimately, they are detrimental.</p><p>Politically speaking, the publication reports Johnson is registered as independent, and has attended both the democratic and republican convention.</p><p>Here’s how some Twitter users responded to Johnson’s announcement.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I’m voting for you for president if you really run <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">@TheRock</a> lay the smack down to America</p><p>— Screw Dreams (@DjScrewJr) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">December 14, 2017</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Hopefully President <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">@TheRock</a> will bring back the People’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">#NetNeutality</a> regulations in a few years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">pic.twitter.com/4Z2q2SWt8k</a></p><p>— Vivek Ramgopal (@VivekRamgopal) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">December 14, 2017</a></p><p>;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5nEosXNnmStoJViv7CvymaprqaenruoecWoqWaooprAqrDEp6tmamBngW6BlG1ua2pf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

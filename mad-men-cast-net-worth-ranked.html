Noire, helping him earn a net worth of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 million</a>.</p><h2 id=rich-sommer-net-worth-4-million>Rich Sommer (Net Worth: $4 Million)</h2><p>Rich Sommer plays a very fun character&nbsp;in the Mad Men world,&nbsp;as Harry Crane, who may not always be the central focus, but is a constant within the show from the very start.</p><p>Crane works as the head of the television department and constantly&nbsp;has to prove his worth, no matter how many good things he does for the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sommer has been part of some huge television franchises throughout his career, having roles in Ugly Betty, GLOW&nbsp;and The Office, so it is no surprise he has a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 million</a>.</p><h2 id=vincent-kartheiser-net-worth-5-million>Vincent Kartheiser (Net Worth: $5 Million)</h2><p>Vincent Kartheiser portrays the controversial Pete Campbell,&nbsp;someone who can be quite slimy at times, frustrating many of the characters on the show and the audience at home.</p><p>However, Kartheiser plays the role to perfection, as Campbell still remains likable at times due to his ability to pipe in some comedic moments that show a totally different side to his character.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Cast Member Of Outlander's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Aside from Mad Men, Kartheiser has made his<a href=# rel="noopener

id=jessica-par-net-worth-6-million>Jessica Paré (Net Worth: $6 Million)</h2><p>As Megan Draper, Jessica Paré may not have been in&nbsp;Mad Men from the very star, but once she is part of it, she certainly makes her mark, as Don's second wife...although that marriage doesn't last either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan's attempts to break into acting certainly have mixed success, but she is a character&nbsp;who fans really enjoyed, with&nbsp;Jessica Paré doing a fantastic job.</p><p>Throughout her career in acting (in real life), Paré has managed to earn a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 million</a>, and while Mad Men is arguably her biggest role to date, she has also appeared in Life&nbsp;and Stardom, as well as other works.</p><h2 id=john-slattery-net-worth-10-million>John Slattery (Net Worth: $10 Million)</h2><p>John Slattery is a vastly experienced actor who has had an incredibly successful career, which has seen him grow a net worth of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million</a>, and although he has been in many different roles, it is Mad Men that he is best known for.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Actors That Turned Game-Show Host</a></span></p><p>That isn't a bad thing either, as Slattery plays one of the show's main characters, Roger Sterling, who is in charge of the advertising company and remains in a position of power throughout the show.</p><p>Away from Mad Men, many people&nbsp;recognize Slattery from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where he portrays Howard Stark, father of Tony, appearing in several movies including Avengers: Endgame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=january-jones-net-worth-10-million>January Jones (Net Worth: $10 Million)</h2><p>January Jones portrays the often conflicted Betty Draper, with Betty being a character who is forced to go through a wide range of different emotions on the show, which Jones performs incredibly.</p><p>Jones was fantastic within this series, playing a key role throughout, even if she doesn't appear quite as much once she is separated from her husband, Don Draper.</p><p>However, away from Mad Men, Jones has worked in several blockbuster movies such as Unknown&nbsp;and X-Men First Class, helping her develop a net worth of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million</a>.</p><h2 id=christina-hendricks-net-worth-10-million>Christina Hendricks (Net Worth: $10 Million)</h2><p>Mad Men is a show that is jam-packed with incredibly strong and powerful women, and Christina Hendricks portrays one of those confident characters.</p><p>Hendricks plays Joan Holloway on the show, who earns her way into a position of power within Sterling Cooper by her own hard work and smart thinking, constantly being one step ahead of everyone else.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Cast Member Of Vikings' Net

id=elisabeth-moss-net-worth-14-million>Elisabeth Moss (Net Worth: $14 Million)</h2><p>As we mentioned, even though Mad Men takes place in the male-dominated world of advertising, it is actually the women who run the show, and Elisabeth Moss' Peggy Olson is the absolute best example of that.</p><p>Peggy rises&nbsp;to be in the same position as the men on the show, moving from simply being&nbsp;Don Draper's secretary&nbsp;to being an equal whom the powerful&nbsp;man cannot live without, as much as he doesn't want to admit it.</p><p>Since Mad Men, Moss has continued her great success, starring in&nbsp;Handmaid's Tale.&nbsp;She's also had plum roles in popular movies such as Get Him To The Greek&nbsp;and Girl, Interrupted, growing a net worth of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$14 million</a>.</p><h2 id=jon-hamm-net-worth-30-million>Jon Hamm (Net Worth: $30 Million)</h2><p>Jon Hamm is at the heart and center of everything that happens in Mad Men, portraying the main character of the show, Don Draper.</p><p>Hamm showcased his incredible personality, managing to make people love Draper as a character, despite the fact that he would often do things that would normally be hated on any other television show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was through Mad Men that Hamm really got his big break, but since then he hasn't looked back, growing a net worth of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$30 million</a>&nbsp;by starring in movies such as Baby Driver&nbsp;and Tag.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Crazy Expensive Things Ellen DeGeneres Has Bought</a></span></p><p class=postsid

The main character became an influential figure for both Tumblr and Instagram fashionistas, making Dominique Swain — who played Lolita — an icon to many.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, like <a href=#>many other 90s teen stars</a>, Swain quickly <a href=#>faded out of the limelight after her breakout role</a>. Here's what we know about her life these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Netflix's Untold: The Girlfriend Who Didn't Exist; What Happened To Manti Te'O After The Catfishing Scandal</a></span></p><h2 id=how-old-was-dominique-swain-in-39-lolita-39>How Old Was Dominique Swain In 'Lolita'?</h2><p>Out of the 2500 actresses that auditioned for the title role of Lolita, Swain, a 14-year-old high schooler was cast alongside Jeremy Irons' Humbert Humbert — the English professor who seduces the nymphet, Dolores "Lolita" Haze (originally 12 years old but made 14 in the movie).</p><p>The actress — who'd previously starred in 1997's Face/Off starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage — had sent her audition tape to New York where she was later flown in, all the way from her friend's house in Los Angeles while her parents were in Hawaii.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's also a huge fan of the book. "I revere the novel, I've read it six times," she shared. "One thing I wrote to the director on my audition tape that I initially sent, is that Lolita didn't have a point of view, she was third person. I told him I know who she is, and I can give her a point of view. That's all I wrote, and that's what I felt."

However, critics think that the 1997 drama limited the actress' career. Natalie Portman, who refused the role when it was offered to her, also feared that it would ruin her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I wasn't willing to do that [Lolita]," explained <a href=#>the Black Swan star</a>. "It wasn't the right thing for me to do at the time. I wasn't willing to put myself in a sexual role when I was 13 or 14, and I still wouldn't do it now. It's not necessary to do more of that."</p><p>According to IMDb, they used an adult body double for Swain's intimate scenes in the movie.</p><p>However, Swain didn't seem to mind those issues at all. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Hollywood Chicago</a>, she said that Lyne "was like a second father" to her, so she felt comfortable doing the controversial film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think your relationship overall with the director is very important," she said. "Some directors think it's not their job to influence the actors at all, and I think that's completely dumb. They hire you because they know what we can do, and when it’s a collaborative vision, it's always going to be better. I can give them what I have as an actor, but if you can figure out what I'm capable of, it does inspire confidence and risk-taking."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To August Alsina After The 'Entanglement' Drama With Will And Jada Pinkett Smith</a></span></p><h2 id=where-39-s-39-lolita-39-star-dominique-swain-now>Where's 'Lolita' Star Dominique Swain Now?</h2><p>Swain didn't retire from acting as most might assume. Though she'll always be associated with Lolita, she's actually starred in recent films like 4 Horsemen: Apocalypse, Meteor Moon, and Eminence Hill, and in the Lifetime TV movies: The Wrong Mr. Right, Obsessed with the Babysitter, and The Wrong Mommy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for her personal life, 42-year-old Swain currently keeps a low profile. But on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her personal Instagram account</a>, she often shares pictures of her traveling with her long-term partner, Jamie Harr. They also have a dedicated travel account, @welovejourneys.

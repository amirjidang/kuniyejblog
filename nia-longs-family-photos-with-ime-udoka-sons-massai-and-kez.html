Though <a href=#><strong>Nia Long</strong></a> and fiancé <a href=#><strong>Ime Udoka</strong>’s own relationship</a> hit a rough patch in September 2022, the Best Man star will forever be committed to her sons.</p><p>“The outpouring of love and support from family, friends and the community during this difficult time means so much to me,” the <a href=#>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air </a>alum told <a href=#>Us Weekly </a>in late September, two days after news broke that the Boston Celtics head coach allegedly <a href=#>had an affair with a colleague in the NBA</a> and was subsequently suspended for the 2022-2023 season.</p><p>“I ask that my privacy be respected as I process the recent events. Above all, I am a mother and will continue to focus on my children,” Long, who shares son Massai, born in 2001, with ex <strong>Massai Z. Dorsey</strong>, and son Kez, born in 2011, with Udoka, added.</p><p>Following his suspension, the former assistant coach for the Brooklyn Nets — who has been in a relationship with Long since 2010 — issued a statement apologizing to “our players, fans, the entire Celtics organization, and my family” for “putting [them] in this difficult situation.”</p><p>In their own statement, the Celtics declared that Udoka’s suspension was due to “violations of team policies” — which allegedly occurred when having a purported “intimate and consensual relationship with a female member” of the team’s staff, according to a report published by <a href=#>The Athletic</a>.</p><p>The sports professional and the Big Momma’s House actress got engaged in 2015, though Long has been candid about her thoughts on eventually walking down the aisle — or not, revealing on Essence’s “Yes, Girl!” podcast in 2020, “I don’t know that I need [marriage] to feel like I’m in a partnership that’s working.”</p><p>As for her relationship with her children, the mom of two can’t get enough of her kids. “I love my boys. They are the light of my life,” the actress told <a href=#><strong>Rachael Ray</strong></a> in 2017. “They are amazing.”</p><p>Long got emotional while adding, “They make me a better woman. Everything I do is for them. … I just want them to have a great life and I want them to respect women and to love women,” joking, “I’m gonna cry now.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Fatal Affair star frequently shares sweet photos with her kids on social media, whether they’re celebrating a big life moment together or simply hanging out and selfie-ing.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Long’s family album with Udoka and her sons:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNku6qtjKWmp5%2BjYrOiucilsGaomKTBsL%2BMsKCtoF2euqZ51J2mpJldqLyvv4ymmKyrkZ56orrDZqKesl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

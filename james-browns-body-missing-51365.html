Since that time, Brown has been reportedly kept at his daughter’s Deanna’s house in South Carolina while a public mausoleum was being built for the music legend.</p><p>Pettit, who had been denied the opportunity to carry out an autopsy to determine Brown’s cause of death, says she has no idea where her father is being kept. “My daddy’s body has disappeared. I have no clue where it was taken, but I need to know where. I’m convinced his death was suspicious and I want the people responsible brought to justice. The only way to do that is to exhume his body and have an autopsy. I cannot understand why one was never conducted.”</p><p>Brown, easily the most influential soul and R&B artist of all time, died in Emory Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta of congestive heart failure and pneumonia. Pettit was one of several individuals to come forward after the Godfather of Soul’s death, claiming to be his love child. She was not named as a beneficiary in his will. —Keith Murphy</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BurrHSZpmrp6ejwG6uzp2wZqWZqMCqusZmbGprZmp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

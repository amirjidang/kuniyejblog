It was so sad.”</p><p>Us <a href=#>reported the breakup</a>, which aired during season 3 of Siesta Key, in July 2019. The pair had been together for three months when Juliette decided to break it off.</p><p>“We had just gone to Greece and he got me this like adorable candle that I really wanted. And I didn’t know that he got it for me,” the JMP the Label founder recalled. “He met me at the beach and he grabbed my favorite bottle of wine. And I was like, ‘Oh, thanks for this <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a>, but we’re done.’ [Robby said,] ‘Maybe you could have given me a heads up.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Siesta-Keys-Juliette-Porter-Reveals-Biggest-Regret-About-Robby-Hayes-Breakup.jpg><p>While the MTV personality hopes her ex, 32, is doing well, they don’t stay in touch.</p><p>“I have him muted on Instagram just because I … don’t like to see it,” she shared. “I love the mute button on Instagram. That is the best thing ever, because you don’t have to unfollow someone. No one has to know that you don’t like them, or you don’t want to see them. It’s great. I’m going to mute everyone.”</p><p>In classic <a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> fashion, the <a href=#>former couple originally met at Stagecoach</a> music festival. The Florida native told Us exclusively that <a href=#>sparks flew “right away” </a>during a <a href=#>December 2019 interview</a>.</p><p>However, the <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> alum noted during the same conversation that his relationship with the reality star “fizzled.”</p><p>“I think [there were] a lot of highs and then the low,” he said at the time.</p><p>While Juliette doesn’t feel great about how she handled things with her former beau, she doesn’t like to dwell on the past.</p><p>“Everything we do in life is meant to be, and we should not regret anything because it taught us a lesson,” she said.</p><p>These days, the swimwear designer is dating <a href=#><strong>Sam Logan</strong></a>. The couple have been together for more than a year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Time just happened so fast,” she said. “We have a great relationship and are very happy.”</p><p>Siesta Key premieres on MTV Wednesday, March 12, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqinaOprm63xLKqZqKlobamwNOeZKmnoqmys3nSoZirnaNiv7CuwbJkoZmpmsBurtGemKStoGK%2FprPRnqto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

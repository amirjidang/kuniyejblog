They got engaged the next year, <a href=#>tying the knot seven months later</a> in October 2019. The two musicians share daughter Baylah, 2, son Augustine, 14 months, and <a href=#>are currently expecting baby No. 3</a>.</p><p class=p1>While neither Barrett nor Foehner won <i>American Idol</i>, they have continued to make music. In 2021, Barrett picked up two trophies at the American Music Awards and one at the CMT Music Awards.</p><p class=p1>Barrett’s successes have meant that other artists have reached out for duets, however, the “obligation” of signing onto the track has made her hesitant to accept offers.</p><p class=p1>“When you accept a song, there’s that goes along with it, that you could sing it on award shows together, you might be doing interviews together,” Barrett said. “What does that look like on the stage? What does that dynamic look like? If I’m singing with another man, is that going to make my husband uncomfortable? Probably.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “And I respect him and love him so much that I’m not going to jeopardize my marriage to do a duet with somebody, you know. Like, I care about this a lot more and I pray and hope and know that God will bless my efforts in trying to keep my marriage straight, and not just for a duet or whatever it is.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Barrett cited her and Foehner’s shared faith as the reason she’s been able to stand strong in her convictions.</p><p class=p1>“It helps me to be very firm no matter what the push is from outside industry and outside people,” she told host <strong>Hannah Love</strong>, <a href=#>who is married</a> to Dan + Shay’s <strong>Shay Mooney</strong>. “I have tons of people say that say to me or have texted me or have commented about me and said, ‘She’s ruining her career by talking about these things, and by X, Y and Z.’ … I treasure a Godly marriage over anything the world could offer because that is so much. I know where I’m going, I’m who I’m going to answer to and it’s not those people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6ampKueqOt0aucraxdqcKzutJmm6ivnmK2r8DIppitnV2ZwqbA0mamrqxdpLNuvsSsp56bpGKzsL6MoaysmpGjsXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

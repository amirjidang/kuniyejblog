This was way before she would get her own talk show or co-host <a href=#><strong>The View</strong></a>. Her film debut came in 1991 when Penny Marshall cast her in A League Of Their Own. It was on the set of this film, however, that Madonna and O'Donnell's world would collide.</p><p>As it turns out, the two became friends and found that they shared a lot in common.

O'Donnell has since spoken about how nervous she was to meet Madonna.</p><p>"For 30-something years. I didn’t have any idea that I would be meeting her," <a href=#>O'Donnell told The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "I was in baseball rehearsals for A League of Their Own. And Penny Marshall called me into the office and said (Penny Marshall voice), 'Madonna’s going to come to audition. If she likes you, and she likes me, maybe she’ll do the movie. Don’t be nervous.' I’m like, 'Don’t be nervous? What do you say to her? How do you connect to her?'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to O'Donnell, the two bonded over their shared grief of losing their mothers when they were very young.</p><p>"I told Madonna my mom died when I was 10, and I’m named after my mom, and so on her gravestone is my name as well."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Actress Refused To Appear In A League Of Their Own When She Found Out Madonna Was Cast</a></span></p><p>The two became close friends in real life and have remained friends to this day.</p><p>"We formed a sister thing in a real way where we stay in each other’s lives and touch base," O'Donnell said.

The following year, her film Body of Evidence was released. The sexuality of all three projects proved to be too much for the public, who heavily criticized Madonna as a result. The singer experienced a level of backlash that had fans worried about the future of her career.</p><p>In 1994, Madonna appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman. Her appearance marked her second time speaking to Letterman, but her first appearance by herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar41980080.jpg><p>Madonna called out Letterman for his constant jokes at her expense on his show.

To top it all off, Madonna protested every time Letterman tried to go to commercial. There were even audience members who booed her and yelled at her to get off the stage.</p><p>Her appearance caused another wave of backlash in the press. In an interview with O'Donnell, the comedian said that she was told by Madonna that the producers encouraged her to swear during the interview.</p><p>"The people at Letterman had encouraged her to do that," <a href=#>O'Donnell told VH1</a>. "That was not Madonna's idea.

"And she would get vitriol at her at the height of her fame. I remember we were doing A League of Their Own and she had brown hair and we would be in an elevator and grown men, you know, would say to her, ‘I like you better as a blond.'

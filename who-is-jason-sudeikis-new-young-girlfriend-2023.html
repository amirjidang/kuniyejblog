If you're looking for a juicy story, there just isn't one." They added that the two were prioritizing their kids at that time. "Of course, their kids are their number one priority and at the forefront of any decision they make," said the insider.</p><p>It even seemed like the two were still friends. "They adore each other and have nothing but the utmost respect for one another," the source said back then. "They will continue to be each other's biggest supporters, especially when it comes to parenting their children and their careers."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wilde apparently remained close to Sudeikis' sister after they moved out of their Brooklyn home at the end of 2019 and relocated to Los Angeles, which became "the beginning of the end" of their relationship. In March 2023, the actress said she was blindsided by her ex's legal tactics over custody of their kids: Otis Alexander Sudeikis, 9, and Daisy Josephine Sudeikis, 6.</p><p>"We were scheduled to start working with a family therapist in California in mid-January. I thought things were calming down and were going to move forward in a more amicable, respectful fashion," she stated in court.</p><p>"Instead I learned on January 10, 2023, that the entire time I was negotiating the parenting time schedule in California [Jason] was plotting to proceed with the New York Child Support proceeding behind my back," she continued. "I am completely perplexed at why he believes that engaging in intimidation or trickery will serve him or our childrenâ€™s best interests."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Jason Sudeikis' Alimony Agreement The Secret Reason For His Ex-Wife Kay Cannon's Insane Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-did-jason-sudeikis-think-of-olivia-wilde-dating-harry-styles>What Did Jason Sudeikis Think Of Olivia Wilde Dating Harry Styles?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/untitled-design-67.jpg><p>In January 2021, a source claimed that Sudeikis was "really hurt" about Wilde dating Styles at that time. "Olivia and Jason ended amicably and both wanted to remain close and stay friends for the sake of their kids and because they have mutual respect and love for one another," they told ET.</p><p>But as it turned out, the <strong><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a></strong> alum was hoping he and Wilde "would eventually reconcile and get back together," which was why "he has been really hurt and somewhat jealous that Olivia has moved on with Harry." At that time, other insiders said that the In Time star had always admired <a href=#>the androgynous performer</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Styles' Vogue cover in November 2020, Wilde confessed to doing "a little victory dance" after casting the young pop <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>icon for Don't Worry Darling. "To me, he's very modern and I hope that this brand of confidence as a male that Harry has -- truly devoid of any traces of toxic masculinity -- is indicative of his generation and therefore the future of the world," she told the magazine.</p><p>"I think he is in many ways championing that, spearheading that," she added. "It's pretty powerful and kind of extraordinary to see someone in his position redefining what it can mean to be a man with confidence."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Harry Styles And Louis Tomlinson Met In A Very Weird Way (Before One Direction)</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-jason-sudeikis-dating-now>Who Is Jason Sudeikis Dating Now?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sudeikis started <a href=#>dating his Ted Lasso co-star Keeley Hazell</a> in 2021 when they were photographed kissing on a beach in Cabo. However, the two reportedly broke up in May 2022 over conflicts in their work schedules. In August 2023, he was spotted on "date" 27-year-old model, Elsie Hewitt.</p><p>The speculations sparked a debate on Sudeikis, 47, dating someone 20 years his junior. "I don't think it's really problematic if she is 27," one wrote on Reddit. "I'm just tired of so many men in Holywood dating women in their twenties when they're way older."</p><p>Wilde, 39, faced similar backlash for dating Styles, who's ten years younger than her. She then addressed the ageist attacks on her in Elle's November 2022 issue, saying: "It's so interesting for me when that comes from women because I'm like, 'Do you plan on not getting older? Or if you already are older, do you feel that you don't deserve the same opportunities in life?'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added: "It's so sad to me to look at that and realize people have such small expectations for their own lives and they are projecting those expectations onto me. And I reject your projections."

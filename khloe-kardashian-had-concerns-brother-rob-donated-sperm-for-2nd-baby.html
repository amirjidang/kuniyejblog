And there’s glimmers of my dad in Tatum. I’m like, this is so freaking weird.”</p><p>Tatum’s similarities to Khloé’s dad and brother were enough to make the Good American founder question her son’s paternity.</p><p>“Because he was an IVF baby or a surrogate baby, I was like, ‘Rob, have you ever donated sperm somewhere?’” Khloé quipped. “I made Tristan do three DNA tests for Tatum. He was so offended. In this family, [Rob being the father] would not surprise me, but that would be so disgusting.”</p><p>Despite her conspiracy theories, Khloé, who also shares daughter True, 6, with Thompson, 33, said the NBA player “was meant to be the father of these kids” even though their romantic relationship didn’t work out.</p><p>“[He] is an incredible father. He did make mistakes, but he’s the nicest guy. And <a href=#>we get along so well</a> now,” she said.</p><p>Khloé and Thompson dated on and off from 2016 to 2021. They split for good after news broke that Thompson <a href=#>fathered son Theo</a>, now 2, with <strong>Maralee Nichols</strong> around the time that he and Khloé were expecting their second baby via surrogate. Khloé spoke candidly on Tuesday about how the paternity scandal impacted <a href=#>her experience with surrogacy</a>.</p><p>“The entire pregnancy of my surrogate, I admittedly buried my head in the sand,” she said. “I was really detached. I couldn’t really face it, I very much think I was in denial that this is happening. So, I didn’t get to really attach during the pregnancy part. … I didn’t even decorate the baby’s room because I didn’t want people in my home knowing. … I was so ashamed.”</p><p>Khloé also recalled having “sensory overload” the first time she held Tatum after feeling so detached during her surrogate’s pregnancy.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I wasn’t at a ton of the doctor’s appointments while my surrogate was pregnant to protect her privacy. I didn’t want paparazzi finding out,” she explained. “I would always be on FaceTime but it’s not the same. … And so for Tatum, when [the doctor] put him on my chest to do skin to skin …. I felt like, ‘I can’t believe this is real.’”</p><p>Despite her tumultuous history with Thompson, Khloé noted that she is “really grateful” for his commitment to their kids, and didn’t want to come off like she was “bashing” him for his mistakes.</p><p>“I’ve seen some other fathers that are not great fathers, and I’m very grateful that I have one that wants to be in their lives, that’s active every single day even though he doesn’t live here full time,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakoJyksm63wKubmquYnq6veceam2abn6Owpr7NrGSbqp%2Bptaa%2BjKumm2WUpLuiwMSdZKyolae6brLOq2RrppRir6Ku2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

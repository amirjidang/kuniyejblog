Thanks to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his numerous shows</a>, Guy Fieri has had a heck of a career and has amassed an impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a>.&nbsp;Never one to miss out on a good time, Fieri always puts on a show when the cameras are rolling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2015, Guy Fieri wound up presiding over 101 weddings, and people were blown away when the news initially broke. It seemed out of place for the Food Network star, but as we learned, this made perfect sense.</p><p>Let’s take it back to 2015 and see the truth behind Guy Fieri presiding over these momentous weddings!</p><h2 id=there-were-101-simultaneous-weddings>There Were 101 Simultaneous Weddings</h2><p>A&nbsp;wedding is typically an intimate ceremony where a couple makes things legal, but in this unique instance, there were 101 weddings all done under one huge umbrella.</p><p>The massive event took place back in February 2015 when the state of Florida officially lifted the ban on same-sex marriage. This was a momentous occasion for the state, and eventually, the rest of the country would get on board later that year, making for one of the most memorable events of the 21st century.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to pull off an event of this magnitude, a lot of planning went into making it happen. It has been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity chef Art Smith</a> was the one who organized the entire event to go down on Miami Beach, and we can only imagine the incredible strings that he had to pull in order to make this happen.</p><p>According to Time, Smith actually began the planning after the ban was lifted a month before the event&nbsp;took place. This means that he had an incredibly small window to pull off the impossible, and it is incredibly impressive to see what he was able to make happen. Then again, having worked for people like Oprah, it makes sense that he could do something like this.</p><p>Time reports that Smith drew inspiration from the film 101 Dalmatians, which is why the amount of weddings was capped at 101. Smith even managed to take a dig at a local politician who was opposed&nbsp;to the marriages happening on the beach that day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Smith would say, “We have our own Cruella De Vil, Pam Bondi. She was determined that she was going to prevent equality from coming to Florida.”</p><p>Now that everything was getting set to get underway, it was important to find someone to preside over the weddings, and the Mayor of Flavortown himself went ahead and stepped on in.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Questioning If Chef Ramsay Really Took A Dig At Guy Fieri</a></span></p><h2 id=fieri-takes-the-weddings-to-flavortown>Fieri Takes The Weddings To Flavortown</h2><p>For many people, Guy Fieri is the lovable Food Network host who has brought us fantastic and entertaining shows like Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. On that fateful day in February 2015, he found himself as the person presiding over 100 weddings in Miami.</p><p>Guy Fieri might not be the first name that comes to mind as someone who would be presiding over weddings, but as we will soon learn, there is a heartwarming reason as to why he was willing to step on in. For the couples that took part in the ceremony, seeing Guy Fieri himself roll up to officiate&nbsp;must have been an awesome feeling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fieri&nbsp;has a unique style to him, and many people have seen&nbsp;him for sporting a number of flames and even a Las Vegas Raiders logo on his arm band, but that day, he made sure to keep his fashion game on point, as seen in photos from the event.</p><p>Now, while it is pretty cool to hear that Guy Fieri was willing to pair up with his buddy Art Smith and make the once impossible happen for these 101 couples, the reason why he went through with the responsibilities of presiding over so many weddings is one that is near and dear to his heart.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Network: All Of Guy Fieri’s TV Shows, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p><h2 id=it-was-in-tribute-to-his-sister>It Was In Tribute To His Sister</h2><p>Many celebrities are completely fine with doing publicity stunts that will help them get in good favor with the mainstream media, but for Guy Fieri, presiding over 101 weddings have an incredible amount of significance to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Turns out, the beloved Food Network host agreed to take part in the festivities as a tribute to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his late sister</a>, who was a lesbian.</p><p>Fieri’s sister&nbsp;never got to see a point in her lifetime when same-sex marriage was legal.

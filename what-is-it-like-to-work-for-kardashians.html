Yet some folks have accepted a job offer from the reality TV family. Sadly, that doesn't mean they wound up happy with the outcome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turns out that working for the Kardashians isn't as cushy as it might seem, despite sometimes-high salaries, like the <a href=#>reported six-figures Kim's nannies earn</a>. From long hours to unreasonable expectations, people who have worked for the Kardash-Jenners are spilling tea, both anonymously and decidedly not.</p><h2 id=are-kardashian-jenner-employees-paid-fairly>Are Kardashian-Jenner Employees Paid Fairly?</h2><p>Some reported ex-employees of the Kardashians have taken to social media to share their experiences. One person who claimed to have been an editor for the Kardashians' now-defunct apps said they were broke all the time.</p><p>The person didn't reveal their salary, but it's safe to say that if they were seeking freelance opportunities on the side (which they said they were reprimanded for), they weren't making a liveable wage.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Difference Between The Richest And The Poorest Kardashian Sister Is Downright Staggering">The Difference Between The Richest And The Poorest Kardashian Sister Is Downright Staggering</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Commenters discussing that former employee and other stories</a> pointed out that a self-proclaimed Kourtney Kardashian nanny took to TikTok to say she couldn't afford to get her car fixed.</p><p>That same nanny, however, also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posts luxurious trips she goes on while caring for Reign and Penelope</a>, two of Kourtney's three kids, notes The Sun.</p><p>In a recap of the nanny's videos, The Sun points out that she bought an SUV that starts at $44K for the base model, plus other expensive items like a Peloton and designer clothes.</p><p>It seems there's a disconnect between the nanny's TikTok and the wages other staff at the Kardashian-Jenner mansions make, though.</p><h2 id=fans-think-the-kardashians-under-pay-employees>Fans Think The Kardashians Under-Pay Employees</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the responsibilities and expectations for unpaid interns, it doesn't seem far-fetched that full-time employees would have far more responsibilities in a Kardashian or Jenner household.</p><p>For example, fans discussed Kim's former assistant, Stephanie, who seemed to not be making a great wage; she was seen driving Kim to a photo shoot in "an old Cobalt," noted one commenter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title='Some Viewers Brand The Kardashians&#39; New Show "Boring"'>Some Viewers Brand The Kardashians' New Show "Boring"</a></span></p><p>Commenters deduced that Stephanie made around $60K per year, which they deemed 'not enough' for Los Angeles living let alone the demands of being Kim's assistant. Regardless, the hourly rate wasn't enough to keep Stephanie in the role, noted eagle-eyed fans who watched Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p><p>Fans did suggest that Khloé was marginally better at paying people what they're worth; they suggest that Malika Haqq was paid a respectable wage back when she was her pal's personal assistant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Malika did leave her role in 2012, though; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's reportedly worth about $600K today</a>, with a job history that also includes acting gigs.</p><p>As for the worker who contributed to the Kardashians' apps, she claimed to make a salary of $35,000 per year. She couldn't afford gas or groceries, she noted, yet the company that hired her for the Kardashian project was unhappy that she was freelancing for Ranker while working for them.</p><p>The worker was also required to work holidays, weekends, and overtime. Another editor in a similar role said she was required to be available 24/7 in case a Kardashian needed to email her "at 2 a.m."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-ex-kardashian-employees-legally-share-their-stories>Can Ex-Kardashian Employees Legally Share Their Stories?</h2><p>Though the Kardashians' TikTok nanny seems like she's allowed to share some details of her experience with caring for Kourtney's kids, she couldn't share everything.</p><p>The nanny has explained that she signed a nondisclosure agreement that prohibited her from answering certain follower questions.</p><p>Commenters on Reddit agreed that it's unlikely any recent employees (or former employees) of the famous reality TV family will be able to speak out. While the family may not have required NDAs for every employee early on, fans agreed that circa 2016 or so, Kim began to talk about NDAs publicly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="All Of Kim Kardashian’s Businesses (Even The Failed Ones)">All Of Kim Kardashian’s Businesses (Even The Failed Ones)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, she even posted on social media about requiring people around her to keep quiet about personal details of her life. After the Paris robbery she experienced, it does make sense.</p><p>Of course, an NDA won't stop people from sharing details anonymously or cautioning others against taking on a job, whether paid or unpaid, with the Kardashians.</p><p>And even the nanny who talked about not being able to fix her car admitted she had moved on from working with the Kardashians but not because of pay issues. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She explained on TikTok</a> that she was looking to "move up" to a personal assistant role, which wasn't an available opening with Kourtney.</p><p>The fact that a personal assistant makes more than a nanny for two kids might hint at what the pay scale is for each role, but the nanny maintains she left on good terms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecitZKWhm5p6tbuMsKaro12bvLN5ypqpnZmjnbaiutJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

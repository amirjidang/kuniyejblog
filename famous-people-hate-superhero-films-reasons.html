For <a href=#>Marvel </a>or DC lovers, you probably get pretty offended when one of your favorite directors slams your favorite franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Actors Who Regret Their Roles in Superhero Movies</a></span></p><p>While there are many that totally praise and love every single flick with superpowers, there are definitely some that have spoken out against it. Just so you can keep track of the haters, we've made a list. Here are 10 celebrities who claim to really hate superhero films, and why.</p><h2 id=martin-scorsese>Martin Scorsese</h2><p>Scorsese is probably the one who kicked off this new trend in 2019. He was one of the first, and <a href=#>most infamous directors</a>, to slam superhero flicks. In fact, he said that "it's not cinema. The closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks".</p><p>So, at least he didn't knock any cast or crew, but he basically says that superhero movies aren't real movies, but mindless and shallow entertainment. Honestly, isn't that what we all expect?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=francis-ford-coppola>Francis Ford Coppola</h2><p>This man actually quotes Scorsese when he discusses this film genre, so it's clear that he's definitely jumping on the bandwagon.</p><p>Coppola is another pretty well-received and famous director, so his voice was pretty shattering on the matter. He actually calls Scorsese's words "kind", and then proceeds to call superhero movies "despicable". So, yeah, maybe not as nice as his fellow director, but at least he's being honest.</p><h2 id=tim-burton>Tim Burton</h2><p>Yes, this director actually worked with DC and was the director for the 1989 Batman&nbsp;and the sequel. However, he's definitely moved on from the genre, and claims he'll never do another superhero flick.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Martin Scorsese Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p>In fact, he seemed pretty annoyed with the whole concept, and posed the question:&nbsp;"how many times can you say 'you're wearing a funny costume' with tights and stuff?" Even more, Burton would like to for once see a happy superhero, which, says a lot coming from this wild man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jodie-foster>Jodie Foster</h2><p>This famous and Academy Award-winning actress definitely has a few words about these studios. She claims that "making bad content in order to appeal to the masses and stakeholders is like fracking...it's ruining the viewing habits of the American population and then ultimately the rest of the world."</p><p>That's pretty bold, and she's another celebrity to kind of relate these franchises to poison. Do with that as you will.</p><h2 id=alejandro-g-i-rritu>Alejandro G. I침치rritu</h2><p>This Mexican director, and Oscar winner for&nbsp;Birdman, was definitely pretty blunt about why he would never make a superhero film.</p><p>For starters, he thinks it's juvenile. He does admit that they "go well with popcorn", but that the "problem is that sometimes they purport to be profound, based on some Greek mythological kind of thing. And they are honestly very right-wing. I always see them killing people because they do not believe in what you believe, or they are not being who you want them to be. I hate that, and don't respond to those characters".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>MCU: The 10 Richest Members, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>That's a pretty personal and politicized blow, and we're pretty confident that Alejandro won't be hitting the theaters for these films anytime soon. Oh yeah, he also calls them poison, too. Sorry to all Marvel and DC fans.</p><h2 id=rose-mcgowan>Rose McGowan</h2><p>This woman is a prominent actress in Hollywood. You'll probably remember her from Scream, Grindhouse, or even on the series Charmed. Like the rest of the people on this list, she also feels the need to show a little activism regarding these franchises.</p><p>She says "I don't want green goblins and tight outfits. I want intelligence, daring, work that drives society forward. I want a mirror, not every cliche regurgitated." Again, her beef with the industry is that it isn't doing society any favors, and honestly, we can't really argue with that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-mangold>James Mangold</h2><p>You might be thinking, isn't that guy a superhero movie director? Yes, he is, and in fact he directed both&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Wolverine.&nbsp;However, he says that his aversion to superhero flicks is what actually allowed him to work on these two movies, and make them different than other Marvel films.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Superhero Actors Who Got Different Roles Than They Auditioned For</a></p><p>He said he worked hard on a character arc with a meaningful conclusion and described most other superhero films as having arcs equivalent to that of "Elmer Fudd" from a Warner Bros. cartoon. Yikes.</p><h2 id=mel-gibson>Mel Gibson</h2><p>This famous actor calls out these franchises for spending exorbitant amounts of money on films that, frankly, aren't that good. Specifically, he calls out&nbsp;Batman vs. Superman,&nbsp;and calls it a "piece of s**t", despite the ridiculous budget that was used for the film.</p><p>Essentially, this man thinks that resources could probably be spent elsewhere, or at the very least, could contribute to a better and more meaningful result.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ridley-scott>Ridley Scott</h2><p>Scott is also a well-known filmmaker and is actually the mastermind behind&nbsp;Alien&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blade Runner.&nbsp;However, he doesn't really understand the popularity of the superhero genre.</p><p>In fact, in 2017, he said that he "can't believe in the thin, gossamer tightrope of the non-reality of the situation of the superhero". So, it's probably safe to say that we're never getting a superhero flick from this guy.</p><h2 id=jason-statham>Jason Statham</h2><p>This famous action movie actor definitely had a pretty personal and defensive response to the bashing-superhero-movies trend. He quotes: "I can take my grandma and put her in a cape and they'll have stunt doubles come in and do all the action. Anybody can do that. They are relying on a green screen and a 200 million dollar budget. So to me, that is not authentic. I'm inspired by an old real star - guys that can really do their thing".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, Statham is pretty salty that these superheroes are pretty basic IRL, and he thinks people should really be fighting each other. Alright, maybe not, but at the very least, he wishes they were a bit more real.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest Grossing DC Films of All Time</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8WapKito2K9prvPpZxmoJGpsm6%2F1Kmcq6CVp7xussilpKxlopqutLvNrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

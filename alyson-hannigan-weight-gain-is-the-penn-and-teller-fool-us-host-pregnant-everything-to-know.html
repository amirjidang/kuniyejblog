Neither actress nor her husband has confirmed the rumors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, her pregnancy rumors spread around without any credible sources or evidence due to her loose-fitting shirt photo. Alyson herself claimed she looked pregnant in that photo.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Likewise, in February 2020, she claimed she didn’t plan to have a third child anytime soon. So, it’s safe to say she will not be the mother of a new child least for now.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But, she has adapted to the new puppy rescued from South Korea.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During her shooting of How I Met Your Mother, she was pregnant with Satayana.

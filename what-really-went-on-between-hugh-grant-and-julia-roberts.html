Hugh Grant has joked that he wants to make a sequel in which he and Julia Roberts' characters, William and Anna go through a hideous divorce, which gives you a major clue into what he thought of Julia Roberts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While they were loved on-screen, it appears as if the actors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't have the best rapport off-screen</a>. Grant has had a fair amount to say about Roberts and the making of the movie, leaving many to wonder what really happened between the two!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Julia Roberts' 'Pretty Woman' Salary Wasn't As Much As You'd Think</a></span></p><p><strong>Updated on July 10th, 2021, by Michael Chaar: </strong>When Notting Hill was released in 1999 and flocked to the cinema to witness Hugh Grant's on-screen chemistry with Julia Roberts, however, he wasn't a big fan off-screen. Hugh mentioned that Julia at times acted like a diva, and claimed that their kissing scenes didn't tickle his fancy. Hugh is relieved now that he has moved on from playing the "charming leading man", however, things could have been very different if Nicole Kidman landed the role. The actress revealed that she would have loved to play the part of Anna, however, she didn't even come close to being considered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-his-favorite-leading-lady>Not His Favorite Leading Lady</h2><p>Grant has acted opposite some fabulous actresses, including Sandra Bullock (Two Weeks' Notice), Renee Zellweger (Bridget Jones's Diary), and Sarah Jessica Parker (Did You Hear About theMorgans?). He has flat out said that he got on best with Sandra and Sarah Jessica.</p><p>He and Julia didn't really hit it off. Things were decidedly standoffish between the two of them on the set. To tell the truth, Julia wasn't all that sold on the movie. And that view has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed by Julia herself</a>. She has said: “When I sat to read [the script], I did not have any great expectations.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And Grant has said that he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sometimes felt she was a real-life diva</a>, the big Hollywood star come to England (complete with her entourage) to make a little film.</p><p>It didn't help that she kept demanding more and more money to finish the film. She went from a $10 million paycheck to a $15 million one over the course of the film. Hugh Grant was not impressed.</p><h2 id=those-kissing-scenes-were-awkward>Those Kissing Scenes Were Awkward</h2><p>And, of course, as the king of romantic comedies, Hugh Grant has voiced an opinion on who the best snogging actress award goes to. He says, hands down that it was Renee Zellweger.</p><p>In fact, he's said that when he and Colin Firth played love rivals in Bridget Jones's Diary they had a contest going on, each trying to outdo the other in those snogging scenes with Renee. Grant thinks Firth was just trying too hard!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And Julia? Well, Hugh has been pretty outspoken about it, saying the love scenes with her were difficult to shoot because her mouth is just so darn big!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Julia Roberts' Least Profitable Film</a></span></p><p>Grant went on Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live in 2015, saying that she "might hate me for saying this but" the kissing scenes weren't all that great because "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has such a large mouth"</a>. He went on to say: "I was aware of a faint echo as I was kissing her." Ouch. Andy went on to ask whether he was still in touch with Roberts.</p><p>He replied: "No. I would be I suppose, but I probably made too many jokes about the size of her mouth. She might hate me by now."</p><p>For a time, the two were on the outs. But they've sort of made up. Not kissed and made up, but reconciled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-kidman-wanted-the-part>Nicole Kidman Wanted The Part</h2><p>Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant share quite a special relationship! The duo currently appear together in the HBO series, The Undoing, which has led to a few conversations between Hugh and Nicole, one of which had to do with Notting Hill.</p><p>After chatting with Nicole about her part playing Lucille Ball, Nicole touched on Notting Hill, and revealed that she would have actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted to play the part!</a></p><p>After being asked how close she was to securing the role, Nicole said, "In my head, I was close.

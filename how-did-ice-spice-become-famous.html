Take Doja Cat's "Gen-Z-only" music, for instance. Even established artists were rumored to be asked by their record labels to "fake a viral moment" on the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, one of the most used tracks on TikTok is by a young female rapper named Ice Spice. You've probably heard her hit song, Boy's a Liar Pt. 2 used in a number of clips.</p><p>Even <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>'s firstborn, North West, is a big fan of the artist. It's no wonder Ice Spice is everywhere these days. She has even been linked to <a href=#>serial It Girl dater, Pete Davidson</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has Sebastian Bear-McClard Said Anything About Emily Ratajkowski Dating Pete Davidson And Harry Styles?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-ice-spice-become-famous>How Did Ice Spice Become Famous?</h2><p>Reports say that Ice Spice just started rapping in 2021 after meeting record producer, RiotUSA while she was going to Purchase College, State University of New York. In March of that year, her debut single, Bully Freestyle came out. It was right after a video of her doing the Buss It challenge went trending on Twitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We ended up clicking, and now having so much success with Munch, I think that just makes us closer," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice Spice told Vogue</a> of her relationship with RiotUSA.</p><p>In August 2022, Drake played her song, Munch (Feelin' U) on Sound 42, his SiriusXM radio station. That caused the track to spread on Twitter and TikTok, eventually making it to Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-2023-04-12-at-8-00-32-am.png><p>In late September 2022, Ice Spice landed a record deal with 10K Projects and Capitol Records. She then dropped her first EP, Like..? in January 2023. The next month, her collaboration with Lil Tjay, Gangsta Boo became her first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, placing at No. 82.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That same month, the 23-year-old performer was featured in the remix of PinkPantheress' song, Boy's a Liar Pt. 2., which was released with a hit music video. It reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest charting spot for both artists back then.</p><p>In January 2023, Ice Spice said of her ascent to fame: "I did work really hard to get to where I am now, and I still am working really hard, every day."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Saweetie Got Famous</a></span></p><h2 id=why-is-ice-spice-viral-these-days>Why Is Ice Spice Viral These Days?</h2><p>Thanks to TikTok, Ice Spice has gotten closer to other A-listers, boosting her demand in the industry these days. One of her most iconic collabs would be the one with North. Unfortunately, their hilarious videos have now been deleted from the @kimandnorth TikTok account due to the backlash on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Netizens claimed that the nine-year-old TikToker "has gone too far," with many agreeing with Ye's plea amid his divorce proceedings: "Don't have my daughter wearing lipstick on TikTok, or don't have her on TikTok at all, if I'm not there to approve that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-2023-04-12-at-8-08-08-am.png><p>Fans also noted that the lyrics on Ice Spice's songs are too explicit for North's age. One tweeted: "'A broke clock is right twice a day.' Kanye was right about not wanting is daughter on Tik Tok. Now she's dressing like Ice Spice, & reciting lyrics like, 'Bet he blowin her back'. Just a reminder: North West is NINE YEARS OLD!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But some fans pointed out that it's actually not that bad, with one Twitter user arguing: "i see why some parents are upset at north west mimicking ice spice considering some of her lyrics… but didn’t we all do some variation of this as kids? i use to sing, rehearse & dress the part to every choreography of ciara’s music videos when i was in middle school."</p><p>Regardless of the consensus on that link-up, that "bad publicity" was still a pretty good one for Ice Spice who went on to be one of the most talked-about figures on social media nowadays— from her personal Instagram posts, to her outfits, and course, her love life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside North West’s Friendship With Selena Gomez’s Sister Gracie Teefey</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-ice-spice-dating-now>Who Is Ice Spice Dating Now?</h2><p>Ice Spice has been linked to a number of famous men, but none of them were ever made official. In February 2023, fans speculated that she was dating Davidson due to her sudden popularity — a pattern on the <strong><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a></strong> alum's dating habits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But on Valentine's Day, Ice Spice's previous collaborator, Lil Tjay bought her an expensive rose gold, diamond-encrusted watch, a Richard Millie RM-05, which is said to be worth tens of thousands of dollars. That instantly sparked romance rumors, but neither party confirmed it.</p><p>At one point, Ice Spice was also spotted partying with Drake in Toronto, which made fans wonder if they were dating. The latter even co-signed the new rapper's song, Insta in January 2023.</p><p>But now, it seems like the two aren't as close anymore. The Certified Lover Boy unfollowed the No Clarity hitmaker on Instagram. She later addressed the issue, saying: "He did [unfollow]. I don't know why though." She noted that "it's OK," and that "it's all love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in November 2022, Drake seemingly dissed Ice Spice on his track, Her Loss, where he raps: "She a ten tryna rap, it’s good on mute, yeah." The latter responded on Twitter, saying, "at least ima 10."</p><p>After that, Ice Spice has also been associated with Stranger Things' Caleb McLaughlin, and most recently, with NBA star Jordan Poole who allegedly spent $500,000 on their first date. Neither was proven to be true.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecicnGaroJ6wpnnBnpqopZVis6K5zq6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

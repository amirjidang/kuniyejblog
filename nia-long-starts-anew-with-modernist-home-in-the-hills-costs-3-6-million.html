Best known for her work in Black cinema, Long rose to prominence after starring in the film Boyz n the Hood, and for her portrayal of Beullah "Lisa" Wilkes on the NBC sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Nia Long recently split with longtime fiancée Ime Udoka, amid very public accusations that the now-suspended Boston Celtics head coach had an inappropriate relationship with the team’s travel planner.

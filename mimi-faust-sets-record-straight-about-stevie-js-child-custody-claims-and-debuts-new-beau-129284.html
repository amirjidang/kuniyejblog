The “<a href=# id=auto-tag_love-and-hip-hop-atlanta_3 data-tag=love-and-hip-hop-atlanta>Love and Hip Hop Atlanta</a>” reality star stopped by Egypt on V103 Atlanta to clear the air about some messy rumors going around concerning the father of her children. Here’s a bit of the conversation:<span id=more-129284></span></p><p>Mimi: This is what happened. His dad as in town. Eva has not seen her grandfather since she was maybe 18 months. I went over, dropped the baby off so she could spend time w her grandfather and that’s the gist of his having custody.<br>Egypt: Okay, so ya’ll never went to court?<br>Mimi: Never went to court ever.<br>Egypt: But he started calling you a lot of names you said when you went to drop her off. Why was this?<br>Mimi: I didn’t want to come in. He invited me in and I said why would I do that?<br>Egypt: You’ve been pulling back from that relationship.<br>Mimi: Completely. There is no relationship there. I try to co-parent. I’m not sure what he’s doing or trying to do. Obviously you see what he’s trying to do: messy, drama, lying still. Constant. It never stops.</p><p>Yikes. But on the up side, there’s a new man in Mimi’s life (who has an uncanny resemblance to Steebie). His name is Nikko. The two met some years ago and have reconnected on a more intimate level.</p><p>Egypt: So Nikko what do you like so much about Mimi?<br>Nikko: Man, she’s the one, look at her.<br>Egypt: The ONE?? Like put a ring on it the one?<br>Nikko: She’s the one.<br>Egypt: When a man says that they usually mean it. They usually know we’re the one before we know that they’re the one.<br>Mimi: Right.<br>Egypt: You’re glowing!<br>Nikko: I mean that glow is for a reason.<br>Mimi: I’m happy.</p><p>Click <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a> to listen to the rest of the interview.

By the time the song was released in 1995, Grohl and Love had been fighting for a while, and it was clear that it would be a while before they could find a way to get along. In fact, people have been talking about their tricky relationship for several decades now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/courtney-love-made-major-changes-to-her-27-000-per-month-new-york-apartment-and-got-kicked-out-because-of-it.jpg><p>The lyrics from "I'll Stick Around" paint a picture of the problems that Dave Grohl had with Courtney Love. As Far Out Magazine pointed out, he wrote a line about "rehearsed insanity." The other lyrics also explain how he felt about his late bandmate's wife:</p><p>"I've taken all and I've endured/One day it all will fade, I'm sure/I don't owe you anything, I don't owe you anything.../I had no hand in your ever-desperate plan/It returns and when it lands, words are due/I should've known we were better off alone/I looked in and I was shown, you were too."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dave-grohl-has-a-strict-rule-when-it-comes-to-singing-nirvana-songs.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Dave Grohl Has A Strict Rule When It Comes To Singing Nirvana Songs</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dave Grohl has specific rules when it comes to singing Nirvana songs, especially following Kurt Cobain's passing.</span><p>From those lyrics, it seems that Grohl was saying that he wanted to move on with his career and not have to think about Love. Of course, things were very complicated between Grohl and Love back then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The A.V. Club, there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many songs that reference Courtney Love</a>, and "I'll Stick Around" is one of them. The website reported that Dave Grohl didn't share that he wrote "I'll Stick Around" because of how he felt about Courtney Love for quite a while. Eventually, though, he explained:</p><p>"I've denied it for 15 years, but I'm finally coming out and saying it.

It couldn't have been easy to navigate the next phase of his music career while mourning the loss of Cobain. This is an experience that no one should have to go through.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video for "I'll Stick Around" was also about Courtney Love</a>. According to Loudwire.com, the director, Gerald Casale, said in an interview on Apple Music Hits' show Rock Classics Radio that the "menacing ball" referred to her. He explained that when he talked to Grohl about whether the song was really about Love, Grohl said "My lips are sealed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-06t142355-058.png> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/him-frontman-ville-valo-had-a-hilarious-story-about-meeting-foo-fighters-dave-grohl-for-the-first-time.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Dave Grohl Probably Didn't Get Paid Much For This Expensive Super Bowl Advertisement</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dave Grohl had an iconic Super Bowl commercial spot, but it's unlikely he made a ton of money for it.</span><p>Casale told Rock Classics Radio, "What nobody knows is that what that viral ball represented, that menacing ball ...that represented Courtney Love. Yep. I'm here to tell you for the first time... I'll tell you why I did that.

Ever since it was first released, many people have thought that the song lyrics were about Kurt Cobain. It makes sense that people felt this way since Cobain's former bandmates must have been working through a lot of grief and tough emotions. It must have been hard not to think about Cobain when picturing how the rest of their lives and careers would go.</p><p>In 2014, when he was interviewed by The Guardian, Grohl was asked if the song referred to Cobain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/untitled-design-71.jpg><p>Grohl admitted that it's possible for his feelings about Cobain to have shown up in the songs that he wrote, but he didn't sit down with the intention of talking about the late musician.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Happened Between Ville Valo And Dave Grohl?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dave Grohl and Ville Valo had an unforgettable experience meeting for the first time.</span><p>Grohl said, "Well, it's weird. It's hard to deny that the personal experiences of the last four or five years haven't made their way into any of these songs, so... like I said, I don't set out to write about anything although it has to be in there.

According to NME, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grohl wrote "Let It Die" about Love and Cobain's romance</a>. The song was included on the Foo Fighters album "Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace," which was released in 2007.</p><p>He said, “There are a lot of people that I’ve been angry with in my life, but the one that’s most noted is Courtney.

It's still hard to forget the tough relationship that they had for a long time, and the Foo Fighters song "I'll Stick Around" is a prime example of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6VYrSzu8elZK6rlZl6p7vOZp2in5ipsrO%2FjKymp59dqbxuv8uapGabn6q%2FtbrEsmSlp6aaeqKy056pZqOlp8Fur86bmKKmo2Kxpq3ToWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

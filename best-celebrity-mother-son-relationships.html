Of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fathers will have a bond with their sons</a> while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mothers carry an infallible relationship with their daughters</a>, but don't think that a mother's love for their sons (or vice versa) can ever be considered a mismatch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Celebrity Kids Are Following Their Famous Parents' Footsteps</a></span></p><p>The sentiment has been clearly expressed in Hollywood especially, where mothers love to show their baby boys off on the 'Gram, and those same boys boast about the superwomen in their life at any chance they get.</p><h2 id=jack-and-sharon-osbourne><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Jack And Sharon Osbourne</strong></span></h2><p>The Osbourne family as a whole was always a weird bunch, hence why their reality show was such a staple of early 2000's television and, really, pop culture as a whole. America viewed them as the closest thing we had to see a real-life interpretation of The Addams Family.</p><p>Above all else, one of the most endearing relationships was that between Jack and Sharon Osbourne. Whenever Ozzy was too wrapped up in his music to give his son attention, Momma Ozzy swooped in for her baby cub. That relationship remains strong to this day, heading into their new&nbsp;Want to Believe show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=victoria-and-brooklyn-beckham><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Victoria And Brooklyn Beckham</strong></span></h2><p>Calling back to that quote from the intro of this article, Brooklyn Beckham's best friend may very well be his mother in this scenario. It feels like the former Spice Girl has kept her son connected to her hip ever since he was born.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of Celebrity Kids Who Look Identical To Their Parents</a></span></p><p>It seems like she is even closer to Brooklyn than she is his siblings. That is not to say that she is not close with her other children, but it is just a testament to how strong her relationship with Brooklyn is. As of now, she has committed to sewing the dress for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fianc√©e, Nicola Peltz,</a> as their wedding approaches.</p><h2 id=robert-and-terri-irwin><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Robert And Terri Irwin</strong></span></h2><p>The world lost a special soul the day that the original Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin, died following an encounter with a stingray. To this day, many of us are still reeling from the loss of our favorite wholesome zookeeper and wildlife expert.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is why it has been so refreshing to see his son Robert and his widow Terri carry on the late Steve Irwin's legacy on Crikey! It's the Irwins. In real life, they continue to run their own zoo together in Australia and educate millions of people around the world on animals by using social media.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-and-saint-west><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Kim Kardashian And Saint West</strong></span></h2><p>Truth be told, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian's relationship with all of her kids</a> is just pretty darn cute. Say what you will about her as a reality star, businesswoman, or even a fledgling lawyer. One thing that cannot be denied is that she's proven to be a wonderful mother to her children.</p><p>This has especially become pronounced whenever we see her in social media pics with her middle child. Her relationship with her daughter is naturally great, and her baby child's only a year old, but she's really hit it off with Saint so far. They're adorable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ciara-and-future-jr><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Ciara And Future Jr.&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Although the father of her first son, Future, is no longer in their lives, Ciara and Future Jr. have been having a grand ole time together. With that said, her husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell Wilson has more than fulfilled his role as the man of the house</a> to all of their children and being a stellar stepdad, Future Jr. has already come into his own for his mother at the age of six.</p><p>He's already filled out roles of being a ray of sunshine, hug enthusiast, and occasional workout buddy, as we've seen time and time again on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciara's official Instagram page</a>.</p><h2 id=carrie-underwood-and-isaiah-fisher><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Carrie Underwood And&nbsp;Isaiah Fisher</strong></span></h2><p>Speaking of occasional workout buddies, five-year-old Isaiah Fisher has been exactly that for country star Carrie Underwood, and more. She has even gone as far as to bring her son inside of the sound booth to record some jams with her, including "Little Drummer Boy."</p><p>It truly appears that these two do just about everything together already. Not only does it tell how fast they've crafted a lovely relationship early in the boy's development, but it hints at just how strong their relationship will be by the time he's a teenager or even a fully formed adult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-and-mason><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Kourtney Kardashian And&nbsp;Mason&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Mason is not only the oldest child in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney Kardashian's household</a>, but he also happens to be the oldest out of all of the Kardashian sisters' kids. That essentially positions him as the future patriarch of the family, but rather than focus on being the number one man in the Kardashian family, he just needs to focus on being the number one man in his mother's life.</p><p>With Kourtney being reportedly single as of this writing, it means that gives all of her energy and attention to her oldest son, and their relationship is all the better for it.</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-and-reign><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Kourtney Kardashian And&nbsp;Reign</strong></span></h2><p>With 10-year old Mason being the oldest out of Kourtney Kardashian's pack, it would be safe to assume that she is most likely closer to him than the rest of her children. However, her relationship with her youngest child, Reign, puts that theory to the test.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let us not forget there was an "incident" in public some time ago -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> reported by The Blast </a>last fall - where the then-four-year-old had flipped the bird to paparazzi cameras following him and his mother. Clearly, he is a chip off the ole block and is already showing shades of his personality. Shows how close they are.</p><h2 id=max-and-christina-aguilera><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Max And Christina Aguilera&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Christina Aguilera may have herself a new daughter thanks to her new partner Matthew Rutler, but 12-year-old Max is always going to be her little man. Their relationship shines greatly thanks to the pictures she posts of them on her social media pages.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities Who Surprisingly Have Famous Parents</a></span></p><p>Just look at this picture, for example, and pay close attention to the sheer joy in the singer's eyes to be so close physically with her son. The physicality highlights just how close they are as a mother and son family unit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luca-and-hilary-duff><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Luca And Hilary Duff</strong></span></h2><p>Hilary Duff's first marriage to then-husband Mike Comrie did not quite go accordingly to plan, seeing as the actress and the hockey player went on to divorce&nbsp;in 2016 after having tied the knot just six years earlier, but we take it that the former&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire star does not have much to complain about.</p><p>After all, she at least got herself a neat son out of the failed deal, especially one who she is clearly fond of. We doubt that she would trade her son for the world, failed marriage, or not.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All The Celebrity Babies Born In 2020, During Quarantine</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqukYrCmuMSbqaKsqWK6sMDHnqlmq5%2BjerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvNJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

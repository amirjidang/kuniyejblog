Many fans of the game, deemed by Swift as the “Brads, Chads and dads,” have <a href=#>expressed their discontent</a> over the pop star being shown on TV. But for Travis, he doesn’t care what the haters think of his romance.</p><p>“We’re just two people in a relationship supporting each other and having fun with it. It’s nothing more than that,” he explained. “As much as the world wants to paint us as the enemy, we just have fun with it. We enjoy every single bit of it.</p><p>Swift is expected to attend Super Bowl LVIII later this month but faces a <a href=#>tough time commitment</a>. Following the Grammys, Swift is set to start up the international leg of the Eras Tour in Japan. The singer has four shows in Tokyo, with her last show scheduled for Saturday, February 10. She has yet to speak publicly about her travel plans ahead of the game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dmLyvssirpKxlmJp6uLXLpWSnp6RirrXAxKebZmpgZ4Fus9GapKaxo2LEqsDHZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

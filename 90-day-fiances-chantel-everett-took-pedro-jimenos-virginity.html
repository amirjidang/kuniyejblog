However, she then realizes her mistake, explaining, “You know what is the reason that I said that is I think we got married at 25. It should have been 23. I know he was a virgin when I met him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Chantel-Everett-and-Pedro-Jimeno-Confront-Marital-Issues.jpg><p>The Dominican Republic native immediately gets embarrassed and laughs, walking away from the stand.</p><p>“That never was revealed,” he admits, which surprises Chantel, who responds, “I thought everybody knew.

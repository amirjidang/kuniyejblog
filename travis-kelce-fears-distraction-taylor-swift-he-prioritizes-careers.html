"He doesn't want to lose the stability that he has with his creative lady, and will come to visit a few European destinations with her when she's touring the continent."</p><p>The celebrity expert continued, "However, Travis doesn't want to overstay his welcome. The 8 of Wands Tarot card says that when the athlete feels that he's more of a hindrance, he'll catch a flight home.”</p><p>Honigman said that he knows in the short-term Taylor may be sad they’re separated, but Travis apparently believes it’ll be best in the long-term.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-19t095022-884.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Parents’ Separation Deeply Affected Her Music And Career, Here's How">Taylor Swift's Parents’ Separation Deeply Affected Her Music And Career, Here's How</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's relationship with her dad and mom and their separation was the inspiration for some her best songs, including 'The Best Day'.</p><p>“[He] respects the fact that Taylor is working and would rather miss her from afar than disturb her close by,” she continued. “He'll have the opportunity to pop over again, a few weeks into the European leg of her tour, and so he'll visit Europe with her a second time before the season starts.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-may-want-to-focus-on-his-rumored-reality-show>Travis May Want To Focus On His Rumored Reality Show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-3.jpg><p>It may not only be Taylor’s career that Travis is thinking of. Recent reports claim that NFL star is being <a href=#>considered by several networks for his own reality show</a> alongside his brother Jason Kelce. The show would likely explore their personal lives. Jason, who announced his NFL retirement earlier this year, is married to Kylie Kelce and they have three kids. But it’s likely Travis’ romance with Taylor that would be the storyline fans are eager to see (though it’s unclear how down Taylor would be for a reality show role).</p><p>"Producers are sniffing around the entire Kelce family, especially Jason and his wife Kylie," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider claimed.</a> "The idea is to make them a more relatable version of the Kardashians."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The level of interest in the Kelces since Travis started dating Taylor has not gone unnoticed in Hollywood, but it's also very clear that they're super thirsty for attention,” they continued.</p><p>According to the insider, Travis and Jason are enthusiastically seizing "every moneymaking opportunity" that presents itself, and they exhibit no hesitation in sharing their lives openly. Consequently, the prospect of a reality show appears to be an obvious choice for them.</p><p>This sentiment aligns with previous reports indicating a significant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">boost in Travis' net worth, which is attributed to his association</a> with Taylor. This newfound financial status not only opens doors to lucrative promotional deals but also contributes to heightened sales of his merchandise, particularly his jerseys, so it would make sense that Travis is eager to take advantage of other opportunities to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grow his reported $30 million net worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5llpqus7%2BMnaCsrKKWsLW1zqdkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXZ2ybrzRoqaroaSex6a%2FjJyYq52Vp8Bw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

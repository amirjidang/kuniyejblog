Best known for <a href=#>introducing the world to Sydney Sweeney</a> and its frank depictions of teen addiction, Euphoria also quickly became highly controversial. Given the impact that Euphoria had on pop culture, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that lots of actors would do just about anything to join the show’s cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Sydney Sweeney Is The Most Promising Star Of 'Euphoria'</a></span></p><p>After appearing in the first season of Euphoria, Javon Walton’s role in the show was upgraded to recurring during the show’s second season. Since the second season of Euphoria was filmed, <a href=#>the show’s stars have said a lot about its production</a>. Despite that, Euphoria fans still have a lot of questions about the show. For example, many fans want to know how much starring in Euphoria added to Javon Walton’s net worth.</p><h2 id=who-is-javon-walton>Who Is Javon Walton?</h2><p>Years before Javon Walton made his acting debut, the youngster was already proving that he was destined to lead an extraordinary life.

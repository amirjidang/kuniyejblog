But she has spent the last few years raising her family in kids in Franklin, Tennessee. According to People, she bought a house in 2020 when she was moving on from her ex-husband Jay Cutler. Given the time that Cavallari has spent in the southern state, it might not come as a total surprise that she has recently been linked to Morgan Wallen, who is known for his country <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong>.</p><p>Kristin Cavallari and Morgan Wallen have each had some very public relationships, and since they have each been on the dating scene for the past few years, it's no wonder that people wonder when they will settle down.

According to Aceshowbiz.com, when the Instagram account asked "Chaos theory... what are you guys talking about this week?" someone asked, "Morgan Wallen who is he dating???" DeuxMoi replied "Kristin Cavallari?"</p><p>Someone reached out to the DeuxMoi account and wrote, "Morgan Wallen and KCav spotted in Nash."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kristin-cavallari-1.jpg><p>No one has any real and concrete details about Wallen and Cavallari, which suggests that this is just a rumor. There are a few TikTok posts about the stars seen in an elevator in a building in Chicago.</p><p>According to a post in the SubReddit CelebWivesofNashville, DeuxMoi then said that Cavallari was seeing another singer, Riley Green.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Laguna Beach Ruin Kristin Cavallari And Lauren Conrad's One-Time Friendship?</a></span></p><p>There is no proof that Kristin Cavallari is dating Riley Green, either, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/morgan-wallen.jpg><p>Since DeuxMoi reports on tips and comments from fans of the Instagram account, they often share dating rumors that end up not being true. If Kristin Cavallari and Morgan Wallen did meet up in Nashville and go out on a date, there is no other information out there about it.</p><p>They haven't said that they were together, either. While it's still possible that the stars could confirm that they are dating and more details could be shared in the future, that might not end up happening.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-has-morgan-wallen-dated>Who Has Morgan Wallen Dated?</h2><p>There were <a href=#>rumors that Morgan Wallen dated Olivia Dunne</a>, but there doesn't appear to be any evidence that is true.

He said, “Not right now, I don’t. I had a girlfriend for a while. Not recently. That was the last one I had. I don’t have anybody right now. It’s kind of hard."</p><p>Wallen explained the reason why it can be tough to date. He said, "Just how busy I’ve been. I got a son, I got an album, I got a tour, I’ve got all these things I do. I go hunt, it’s really hard for me to make time for that. I want to, though. I think I’m coming up on my ‘settle down phase.’ We’ll see. I’m not in a hurry.”</p><p>Since the singer made those comments just a few months ago, it's possible that he's still single and that his busy life is still making dating a major challenge.</p><h2 id=who-has-kristin-cavallari-dated>Who Has Kristin Cavallari Dated?</h2><p>It doesn't seem that Kristin Cavallari has had any major relationships since she and Jay Culter got divorced in 2020.

I dated a little here and there but no one serious. I am finally in a place where I’m ready for a relationship." She continued, I realize that didn’t really answer that question.

I just think it's because I don't have time for bulls--t anymore."</p><p>She also said that she is all about her friends and her kids rather than searching for love right now and explained, "It's really not important to me right now. It's just not with where I'm at in my life."</p><p>It doesn't seem like Kristin Cavallari and Morgan Wallen are dating.

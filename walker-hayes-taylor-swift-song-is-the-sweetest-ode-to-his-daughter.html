True story time,” he captioned video footage of the pair performing the then-unreleased single in their kitchen.</p><p class=p6>To promote the release of “Taylor Swift” on Friday, September 29, Walker uploaded <a href=#>a clip of Swift cheering</a> for rumored boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a>’s Kansas City Chiefs to his Instagram Story. He added a “Listen to ‘Taylor Swift’” button to the post, which linked to the song’s Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music pages.</p><p class=p6>Walker and Laney were <a href=#>high school sweethearts</a> — who met during a school production of <i>Little Shop of Horrors </i>— before they tied the knot in 2004. Since then, the “Fancy Like” singer and Laney have gone on to <a href=#>welcome six children</a>: Lela, Chapel, Baylor, Beckett, Loxley and Everly. (The duo’s seventh child, daughter Oakleigh, <a href=#>was stillborn in June 2018</a>.)</p><p class=p6>“It’s important that your father loves you and that you know it,” Walker told <a href=# rel=noopener>Fatherly</a> in 2020 after his approach to parenting. “I know it’s important from being a son. I know my dad loves me. It has helped me to grow into a man. I always want them to know I’m in their corner.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p6>He continued at the time: “We don’t wake up as their parents and know every single thing we’re doing. I tell my 13-year-old all the time that we’re learning as we go along. It’s important to teach them to forgive themselves and each other.”</p><p class=p6>Walker Hayes’ <i>New Money </i>EP is out now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6apJuav260wLKcrGWklsatu9FmqrChlql6tLvNoGSiq12ptaZ50rCcnqyVqMFuu8OeZK2nXZ22tHnDmqygoKSav3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

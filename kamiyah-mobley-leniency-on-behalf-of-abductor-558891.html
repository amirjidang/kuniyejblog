In fact, Mobley is pleading for leniency on <a href=# id=auto-tag_gloria-williams_1 data-tag=gloria-williams>Gloria Williams</a>’ behalf. Apparently, Mobley knew two years before law enforcement closed in.</p><p>Williams posed as a nurse and <a href=# id=auto-tag_kidnapped_1 data-tag=kidnapped>kidnapped</a> Mobley, from the then-University Medical Center in Jacksonville, Fla., hours after her birth. She was raised as Alexis Manigo in South Carolina. Williams, 52, confessed last year. But in a way, she had to.</p><p>18-year-old&nbsp;Mobley had been looking for a job and without legal documents for her “daughter,” Williams knew that the tale would begin to unravel. Mobley was found in South Carolina, unharmed.</p><p>Mobley has been working to build a relationship with her biological parents, Shanara Mobley, 36, Craig Aiken, 42, and her siblings. But she’s encountered reasonable conflict. The woman that she recognized as her mother for 18 years was the only one she’d ever known so a harsh sentence is mortifying.</p><p>Naturally, Mobley’s biological mother is saddened by her defense of Williams, the woman who took her child from her for nearly a lifetime. But Mobley says, “It’s not like she took me and tortured me my whole life. She took care of me very well.”</p><p>However, she is aware of the difficulty. “It’s been harder for my mother to cope. We are working on our relationship,” she told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Daily Mail</a>. “I don’t like to define which one is my mother, I like to be respectful of both parties.” Mobley is opting for neutrality to avoid sparring. It seems that she acknowledges both women as her mother in one way or another. In addition, she sympathizes with Williams.</p><p>Williams was arrested last January after a friend she told of the kidnapping gave that information to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. After going to Mobley’s high school and discovering a fraudulent birth certificate and Social Security number, investigators moved toward the family for a DNA test which would later prove that Mobley was a missing person.</p><p>If convicted, Williams could face life in prison. Her court date has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">delayed</a> to Feb. 12.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6CurrXYmp9mpZ%2BXuabFjKWcp6GVo7C6ec6nZJudmJa5p3nOn2SampSqsLW70WZsbnBobn5w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

I think he passed out a time or two in there. He doesn’t even remember it. Ric Flair now is trying to leave a legacy and he should have left it alone, or changed a lot of things in that match, because his legacy now is tarnished. I don’t know. Ric Flair is full of s**t and always has been.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>However, this response did not sit well with Mantell, who has been critical of Flair in the past.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mantell’s criticism of Flair’s last match</h2><p>Mantell spoke on his podcast, Story Time with Dutch Mantell, about Flair’s performance in his comeback match.&nbsp;</p><p>He claimed that people had written to him expressing concern that Flair was going to die in the ring.&nbsp;Mantell also stated that Flair had passed out during the match and didn’t even remember it.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Mantell, Flair’s attempt to leave a legacy with his last match event has backfired and tarnished his own legacy.&nbsp;He further accused Flair of being <strong>“full of s**t and always has been.”</strong></p><p>Flair fired back at Mantell with a scathing tweet in which he accused Dutch of not having a legacy in pro wrestling.&nbsp;</p><p>Mantell responded on Sportskeeda Wrestling’s Smack Talk, taking multiple shots at Flair and even mocking his iconic “Woo” catchphrase.&nbsp;</p><p>He also claimed that 90% of the fans agreed with his statement about Flair’s Last Match.</p><p>As per Mantell, Flair’s response to his criticism was disrespectful because he did not tag him in the tweet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Flair and Mantell’s wrestling history</h2><p>This is not the first time that Mantell has criticized Flair. He previously accused Flair of lying about being in Puerto Rico when Bruiser Brody was killed in 1988.</p><p>Flair and Mantell have a history that dates back to their time working together in the wrestling industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Their current feud stems from Mantell’s comments about Flair’s Last Match event, which Flair took offense to.</p><p>The beef between Flair and Mantell shows no signs of slowing down, with both men taking turns at each other on <a href=#>social media</a> and in interviews. It remains to be seen if they will reconcile or if their feud will continue to escalate.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, it is clear that Mantell’s criticism of Flair’s Last Match has struck a nerve, and Flair’s response has not done much to win him any supporters.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2ByJxkn6SRnr9usNStmqFlnZa7tbHLpWScp56pv7DCxKuqsmWfo3q1tMRmo5qrpGK6osDCoWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

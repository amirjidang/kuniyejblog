When temperatures rise, we’re sticking to shorts! But if you’re heading to the office, finding the right pair of shorts to wear is a bit of a challenge. We need options that still look and feel professional, so there are a few factors to consider while shopping for work-friendly attire.</p><p>For starters, we may want to avoid materials that don’t necessarily suit a work setting. Denim shorts may be off the table, but there are plenty of other fabrics that are equally as comfortable! We also don’t want to go for shorts that show too much leg and are super skintight. That definitely narrows down our search, but we were able to find tons of amazing options we can wear! Check out the shorts we’re planning on rocking this summer in our roundup below.</p><p><strong>These Long Linen Shorts</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Drop-Womens-Millie-Loose-Fit-Pleated-Long-Linen-Walk-Short.png><p>These shorts are made from linen, which is breathable and ideal for the summer!

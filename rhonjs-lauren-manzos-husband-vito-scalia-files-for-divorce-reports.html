They <a href=#>welcomed their daughter, Markie</a>, in February 2017.&nbsp; “My Markie Girl 💗,” Lauren captioned an Instagram snap of her and the infant after giving birth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-484525959.jpg><p class=x_elementToProof>Speculation that the pair had called it quits first sparked in 2017 when eagle-eyed fans noticed that Lauren hadn’t shared a social media photo of her husband in more than a year. Scalia later shut down the rumors in a January 2019 Facebook post, writing, “We just don’t put our relationship on social media and people can’t seem to understand that. We are perfect!!!!!!”</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Earlier this year, rumors swirled once again when Lauren posted via Instagram while not wearing her wedding ring, Lauren, however, quickly clapped back at people for questioning her relationship status.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>“First of all, I truly give zero f**ks if you admire me or not,” she wrote in the comments section in July. “Secondly, I haven’t been on TV for 7 years.” She continued, “I am allowed to keep many aspects of my life private especially after having a child. If you don’t like it then stay away from my page. Simple as that.”</p><p>Lauren has faced a myriad of changes this year. In May,<a href=#> she revealed that she had lost 80 pounds</a>, crediting weight loss drug Mounjaro for helping her shed the last 30. “I went gluten [and] dairy free over a year ago. I had the Lap-Band, I got it removed again. I got up to 208 pounds,” she told Page Six at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>The former reality star recognized <a href=#>that some “don’t like” or “applaud” the drug,</a> adding, “It’s a shot in your stomach once a week, it’s the same as Ozempic. And honestly, I really do believe that obesity and things like that — they are a major issue with people — it is causing mental health issues for me. You guys have seen the struggle with this since I’m 20 years old, and it’s been really hard for me.”</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Lauren appeared alongside her mom and brothers<a href=#><strong> Albie</strong></a> and <strong>Chris Manzo</strong>&nbsp;for the first five seasons of RHONJ, which premiered in 2009. She and her siblings also starred in the Bravo spinoff Manzo’d With Children, which aired from 2014 to 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2Bjt7R5y5qsq52eYrqiutmoqmagpaivorrDZq2irJ9iwKSty6KYZp6ZobK0ecWoqWacmau8s6%2FEZqmeqJ%2BnwbR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

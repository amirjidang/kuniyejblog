While not everyone has tied the knot or brought a significant other into the public view, fans have been surprised by how quickly the family's few romances have progressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though earlier seasons had a few of the brothers dating around—a difficult thing to do in the Bush—three would later get married, a fourth apparently has a long-term girlfriend, and the youngest two Browns have talked about settling down. Fans have a theory about why the Browns settle so quickly, and it's not just because partners are hard to come by out in the Bush.</p><h2 id=the-brown-marriages-happened-quickly>The Brown Marriages Happened Quickly</h2><p>Brothers Gabe and Noah met, dated, and married their wives on Alaskan Bush People. The two are both dads now and seem to want to raise their kids much the same way they were raised.</p><p>Bear is also married, though his trip up the aisle wasn't an easy one and <a href=#>involved assault charges and an arrest</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All three marriages happened fairly quickly, so much so that fans say, "I feel like I’ll blink my eyes and someone has gotten married and now I’m confused and rewinding to see what I missed lol."</p><p>Another noted of Bear, specifically, "Bear once said he didn’t want kids until he was like 60 or 70 then a season later he’s married with a kid."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Almost Half Of The Alaskan Bush People Family Has Spent Time In Jail">Almost Half Of The Alaskan Bush People Family Has Spent Time In Jail</a></span></p><p>The other Brown siblings don't seem to be in as big of a rush, though.</p><p>Joshua (AKA Bam Bam) has reportedly been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating a former producer from Alaskan Bush People</a> since 2017. Though rumors have swirled about a secret child, it doesn't seem that Joshua and Allison Kagan have any kids together just yet.</p><p>Snowbird and Rain, the only sisters in the Brown clan, haven't ever shown a beau on the series, though in recent episodes, Bird has talked about whether she wants a family and worries over her future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of their brothers, though, are well on their way to growing their own wolfpacks, and fans think there's an underlying motivator.</p><h2 id=are-the-browns-getting-married-quickly-for-money>Are The Browns Getting Married Quickly For Money?</h2><p>Viewers already know that <a href=#>Alaskan Bush People is a reality show (and one with a reputation for being very fake)</a>, so just about everything on it should be taken with a grain of salt.</p><p>Even when it comes to marriage and having kids, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many viewers assume there's more to the Brown kids tying the knot</a> than simply falling in love, even though that might have been what their late dad wanted for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most of the siblings talk about their dad often, and the sons, especially, seem to want to follow in his footsteps and raise their kids in the Bush. There's a theory that Billy Brown left more than some inheritance for his kids, though; viewers think it might come with strings attached.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Alaskan Bush People's Most Bizarre Moments">Alaskan Bush People's Most Bizarre Moments</a></span></p><p>One fan wrote, "I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a trust fund situation set up and they can only access parts of [it] until they are married," later adding, "I just wanna know what those contracts look like."</p><p>Fans already found out that <a href=#>the Browns aren't making the $500K per episode</a> that was once rumored, so could it be that getting married is one way to boost their finances? Many viewers think so.</p><p>One fan acknowledged that they'd never considered the possibility of finances factoring in, but also pointed out that, "If there was a trust find situation, it's inevitable that it would come to an end the older the kids get. Now that they have their own families and have matured in general, they're going to want to have their own contacts with Discovery."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's more to the speculation about the Browns' marriages than simply money, though.</p><h2 id=is-there-another-reason-why-the-browns-rush-to-get-married>Is There Another Reason Why The Browns Rush To Get Married?</h2><p>Fans of Alaskan Bush People do have another theory about why many of the Browns seem to rush marriage. One fan pointed out that really, Gabe and Bear married fastest; Noah did seem to take his time somewhat.</p><p>Noah dated his now-wife for about a year, they reason, so getting married after at least a year isn't too quick. Gabe and Bear, however, married much more quickly.</p><p>Some fans think there's an understandable reason why the guys seemed to lock down their first serious girlfriends; the fact that potential partners are so scarce in the Bush.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will recall the cringeworthy episodes in past seasons where the guys tried dating. It didn't go so well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title='Despite "One Stupid Disaster After Another," Alaskan Bush People Is Still Hugely Popular'>Despite "One Stupid Disaster After Another," Alaskan Bush People Is Still Hugely Popular</a></span></p><p>So it makes sense, one fan wrote, if they were in a rush to put a ring on it when they met someone they liked; "I feel like they hadn’t been exposed to a lot of women and so when they were it was kinda like 'hold on to this one or it’ll be 2 more years before I see another woman'."</p><p>Another commented, "I was more surprised in the beginning of the show that the older brothers were single. But they lived in Alaska where the women to men ratio is about 1:7."</p><p>Other opinions suggest that when Noah got married, it was a reality check for Gabe and Bear, who either didn't realize marriage was an option, or then felt rushed because their little brother was ahead of them in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless, fans will just have to keep watching the show to see how the marriages—current and future—of the Browns play out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlrmiv8qapWaapai1brzEqKelnV2csrV5zJqpq6GVmXq0u4yfmKysXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

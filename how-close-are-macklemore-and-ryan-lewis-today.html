While the star only broke out alongside producer, Ryan Lewis in 2012 after the release of their hit album 'The Heist', fans may not know that he's been making music since 2005. Macklemore has released his first-ever solo album 15 years ago, titled 'The Language Of My World, it was 3 years later that he and music producer, Ryan Lewis got together and created their own hip-hop group back in Seattle, Washington.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After working together for 4 years, Macklemore and Ryan released 'The Heist', which featured hit songs such as 'Thrift Shop' and 'Can't Hold Us'. This instantly put the two on the map and catapulted them to international fame and success. Only 4 years later did the two come back with yet another hit album, 'This Unruly Mess I've Made', however this officially marked the last album the two would work on together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan and Macklemore agreed to break up the group in 2017</a> and fans were crushed!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrity Singers Who Ended Up Discovering Or Producing Other Famous Artists</a></span></p><p>While a break up is never a good thing, it seems as if this had no direct impact on the duo's friendship. Macklemore came out with his most recent album 'Gemini' in 2017, the first album since his split from Ryan, and he explained exactly why Lewis didn't produce this particular album. Macklemore said that "it was a decision that we both came to", all while assuring fans that he and Ryan are still the best of friends. Macklemore referred to Lewis as "his brother" and "one of my best friends", and the move was strictly professional.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Lewis had suggested the split first</a>, claiming that he wasn't the right person to produce Macklemore's next album. "I feel like I would be the worst producer for you right now", Ryan said.</p><p>So, while the split happened, the duo assured fans that it may not be a permanent decision and was implemented in order for Macklemore to make the music he wanted to and it isn't anything deeper than that.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Rappers Who Could Rap As Fast As Eminem</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXaKupLfLnqSoqpVirq%2BwjKuwmqZdobK4tdJmq6icka58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

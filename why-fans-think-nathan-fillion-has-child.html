With an <a href=#>impressive dating history</a> from Supernatural sweetheart Felicia day to Valor heartthrob Christina Ochoa, fans have always wondered whether any of these relationships led to something more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-old-is-nathan-fillion-now>How Old Is Nathan Fillion Now?</h2><p>After his debut, Nathan was cast in a lead role for ABC's Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place before graduating to the crime drama Castle. He has also had countless appearances in TV, animation, and even video games. Fillion has had a love for all things entertainment since changing his career path from teaching to acting back in 1993.</p><p>At newly 51, Fillion celebrated his birthday week with friends just days before the announcement of season five of his current show, The Rookie. Brushing just past his semicentennial anniversary, it's safe to say that he won't be slowing down anytime soon. In fact, with The Rookie gaining more and more traction and success each day it's clear that fans should expect to be in it for the long haul.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even with the success of The Rookie many fans still speculate about his acting skills. It's a recurring joke that <a href=#>his "bad acting" actually ruined Castle</a>, in which Fillion portrayed the titular lead. Yet after running for a thrilling eight seasons, the show ended in a heartwarming conclusion that left fans satisfied.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Truth About Nathan Fillion's Cameo On 'The Big Bang Theory'">The Truth About Nathan Fillion's Cameo On 'The Big Bang Theory'</a></span></p><h3></h3><h2 id=what-happened-to-castle>What Happened To 'Castle'?</h2><p>Some viewers continue to <a href=#>assume that Castle actually ended because of Nathan and Stana Katic's broken relationship</a>. This also led to the rumors that Fillion may have broken up with his co-star, thus solidifying the distance and bad blood. Though this flew under the radar because of Fillion's public profession of well-wishes for his Katic after her exit from the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-nathan-fillion-have-a-kid>Does Nathan Fillion Have A Kid?</h2><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 tweet led fans to believe that Nathan had fathered a child</a> during the shooting of Castle but were led astray by the actor's poor word choice. Upon closer reading, this seemed like more of a shout-out to a fan. It still sparked rumors that he not only had a child but another one on the way.</p><p>The names Fillion dropped turned out to be characters from Fillion's show Firefly, a sci-fi that ran for a single season in 2002. Fillon portrayed the renegade crew leader, Malcolm Reynolds, of the refugee bunch after Earth became one of many war-torn planets. The disappointment of the revelation only led fans to even more outlandish theories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=related-things-got-ugly-behind-the-scenes-of-castle-does-nathan-fillion-have-a-daughter><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Things Got Ugly Behind the Scenes of 'Castle'</a></span>Does Nathan Fillion Have a Daughter?</h2><p>Other sources note that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nathan has not confirmed that he has any children</a>, yet rumors abound that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fillion actually has a daughter</a> with Felicia Day. The two seem to have first met on the set of Commentary! The Musical in 2008 where they both had starring roles. Since then the two have remained friends, and are even believed to have dated for a time.</p><p>Day's child Calliope Maeve Day was born in 2017, and though there have been rumors that Fillion is the dad, Day has not released the details surrounding the birth. The 4-year-old's father remains a mystery, but many are dead-set in the rumors that Fillion is the father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their relationship was shrouded in speculation from the start but with their intertwined history, it's plummeted quickly into the rhythm of the rumors. Calliope does seem extremely happy in all things as the Supernatural actress often posts every milestone and mishap on her Instagram.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>Here's Why Supernatural is the Longest Running Show on The CW</a></span></p><h2></h2><h2 id=does-nathan-fillion-want-kids>Does Nathan Fillion Want Kids?</h2><p>Though he has expressed his love for his family many times on his Instagram, it seems like it will be some time before Nathan starts an official one of his own. After being engaged three times, Fillion doesn't seem like he's down for the big commitment. His latest engagement to actress Mikaela Hoover lasted just months before the two split for unknown reasons.</p><p>Since then, he is believed to have been with actress Krista Allen in 2015, who was with George Clooney for two years in 2002. Fillion and Allen split quietly, outside the public eye not long after getting together. Now, many believe that Fillion is single, and it's unclear if he's looking to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Fillion seemingly unpressed for a family, fans of his work and life can only hope that one day he will choose to continue his legacy.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# title="Here's How Nathan Fillion Really Felt About Stana Katic's Exit From 'Castle'">Here's How Nathan Fillion Really Felt About Stana Katic's Exit From 'Castle'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ytn6Kmm2K7osDHmqVmnpmhuaq7zWafmqtdmLWquMNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

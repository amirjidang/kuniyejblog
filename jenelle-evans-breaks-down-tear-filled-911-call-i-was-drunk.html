A source told Us at the time, “David attacked her in front of everyone and they fell to the ground.”</p><p>However, Evans says that’s not the case. “We had friends over and we had a bonfire and I tripped over a hole, and me and David were in the middle of arguing about something … I went and fell down, David wouldn’t catch me, he tripped over the hole and we both fell down together,” the TV personality tells Us. “And right after it happened, we filmed about it and I was open and honest.”</p><p>The reality star — <a href=#>who married Eason</a>, 30, in September 2017 — touched on the backlash she received from fans, who questioned why she would stay with someone who has come under fire recently for his actions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Teen-Mom-2-Jenelle-Evans-David-Eason.jpg><p>“I totally understand that. I was like, dude, I was drunk and when I get drunk, sometimes, I cry for no reason. I mean I was hurt, I’m not gonna lie about that,” Evans continued. “Yeah, I hurt my shoulder. But I went to the doctor afterwards and it’s just a sprain and I was fine.”</p><p>The Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom author believes that once the upcoming series of Teen Mom 2 airs, the public and her fans will get more clarity on the disturbing incident. “Everyone’s like, ‘Oh, what’s Jenelle’s story? Oh, she’s hiding it.’ No, I’m not hiding it. CPS came to my house, they interviewed me, they know the story. My lawyer knows. Everybody knows except for the public.”</p><p>Despite this bump in their relationship, Evans and Eason are still happily married. “Everything’s fine,” the MTV star tells Us, adding that the couple now have custody of his daughter Maryssa. The pair share 23-month-old daughter Ensley, while Evans has two children, Jace, 9, and Kaiser, 4, from previous relationships.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans of the hit MTV series shouldn’t expect to catch up with Eason and his antics when <a href=#>the ninth season debuts</a> on Monday, January 14, however.

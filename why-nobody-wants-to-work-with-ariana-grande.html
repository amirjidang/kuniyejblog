Since then, she's done 6 studio albums, won numerous awards, and (according to celebritynetworth.com)&nbsp;racked up a net worth of $150 million.</p><p>But, her diva demands are legendary. And her regrets are few. So, she has made a lot of enemies along the way.</p><p>Former staff members, co-stars, celebrities who have met her, and disappointed fans, all attest to her unreasonable demands, arrogance, and what some say is rudeness.</p><p>That's why a lot of people when given the opportunity to work with the diva say 'no way'. Let's have a walk down memory lane to some of the worse <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande diva moments</a>. And, trust us, there have been a lot of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Ariana Grande's Time On 'Nickelodeon' Was Like</a></span></p><h2 id=pity-her-poor-staff>Pity Her Poor Staff</h2><p>Working for Ariana Grande is&nbsp;apparently no walk in the park.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To begin with, you've got to be prepared to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">strong-arm anyone who gets in the way of Ariana being photographed from her "good" left side</a>. Staff pounced on Giuliana Rancic once, forcing her to change position with Ariana so the diva's left side would be on display.</p><p>Staff also complain that they have to intervene when a fan takes a picture of or with Ariana. Ariana must, must, must approve all fan photos. If she disapproves, the staff has to make certain the picture is deleted. It can get awkward at times.</p><p>And if Ariana is appearing on a show, staff have to make certain that she gets the biggest dressing room and that the room is stocked with the snacks and drinks she specifies, or else...</p><p>And if the diva consents to an interview, staff have to make certain that the interviewer does not mention certain topics. Which ones? Well, Mariah Carey for starters. Seems Grande has been dubbed the "young Mariah". And it annoys her. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">And reportedly, Mariah bristles when Grande's name is mentioned</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other taboo topics include her deceased grandfather and Ariana's relationships, past and present.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Ariana Grande Collaborate With Mariah Carey On Her Upcoming Christmas Project?</a></span></p><p>And as ludicrous as it sounds, staff must be prepared to carry her around if she is too tired or wants to conserve her energy.</p><p>Of course, she denies all of this. She is, she says, so totally not a diva. Do we believe her? Probably not.</p><p>It won't surprise you that staff turnover is pretty darn high. People either get fired when they fail to live up to Ariana's expectations or they quit in frustration.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Broadway, Nickelodeon & More: What Ariana Grande Did Before Becoming A Pop Star</a></span></p><h2 id=photographers-hate-working-with-her>Photographers Hate Working With Her</h2><p>Why? Well, she can only be photographed from the left. They must never use red lights or natural light when taking pictures of her. And she has final approval on all photographs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Australian photographer Chris Pavlich tried to do a photoshoot with the diva, she was not happy with the pictures he had taken. So what did she do? She just walked out, leaving staff to make certain the offending pictures disappeared. Ariana concocted some flimsy story about merely leaving to change clothes. But most people saw through that one pretty quickly.</p><h2 id=her-loyal-fans>Her Loyal Fans</h2><p>If you catch Ariana on a good day, she can be charming. But if you catch her on a bad day, lookout.</p><p>At one New York event, she was outwardly very nice to fans. But as soon as she was out of earshot of her loyal followers, she was heard to say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wished they would "f***ing die"</a>.</p><p>One father of a fan has complained that when his daughter won a contest and had the "honor" of meeting Ariana, the singer was cold and aloof and refused to autograph a picture.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is always, always, always about what Ariana wants. Forget anybody else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-celebrities>Other Celebrities?</h2><p>After Nickelodeon's&nbsp;Victorious&nbsp;was canceled in 2013, a mini-feud broke out between Ariana and her co-star Victoria Justice when Ariana outright blamed Justice for the show's cancelation. Victoria clapped back hard.</p><p>What followed? Well, Ariana did another Nickelodeon show called&nbsp;Sam and Cat&nbsp;with Jennette McCurdy. It only ran for 35 episodes between 2013 and 2014. Why? Well, the biggest problem was that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennette and Ariana reportedly didn't get along at all</a>.&nbsp;McCurdy has complained loud and long about Ariana's diva behavior.</p><p>Then when in 2014 McCurdy did a web show called&nbsp;What's Next For Sarah?&nbsp;there was a vain, selfish, rude character called Gloriana. It was hard to miss the fact that Gloriana was firmly based on Ariana Grande. To state the obvious: Jennette and Ariana haven't spoken in years and years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And what does the lead singer for The Cab think of our Ariana? Well, Alex DeLeon met her once and made it clear that he never wanted to see her again. He tweeted: "hope none of my fans ever have the displeasure of meeting â€ª@ArianaGrande. most stuck up, disrespectful person I've ever met in this industry."</p><p>So, why on earth would anybody not want to work with a rude, demanding, arrogant, and self-centered person like Ariana Grande?

While the lives of celebrities seem glamorous from the outside, their lives are not as simple and shiny as they may seem. This could lead them to be susceptible to being recruited to be in a cult. Some cults even target actors so that they have a greater influence over the public. Interestingly, many well-known actors even <a href=#>spent their childhoods</a> as a part of a cult. Over the years, many musicians have grown up in or been <a href=#>roped into cult communities.</a> Despite their high status, they are not as invincible as they seem. Here are some of the musicians who have been victims of different cults' persuasion tactics, and it may surprise you.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Michelle Pfeiffer Was Taken In By A Vegetarian Cult">How Michelle Pfeiffer Was Taken In By A Vegetarian Cult</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=neil-young><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Neil Young</span></h2><p>This musician has strong ties to <a href=#>Charles Manson</a>'s cult, otherwise known as the Manson Family. The Manson Family lived an unusual lifestyle consisting of heavy drug usage and other criminal activities. Interestingly, <a href=#>Neil Young</a> played a central role in helping<a href=#> Charles Manson get a record deal</a>. Young liked Manson because they both liked the same music. These connections and similarities are probably what got him wrapped up in the Family cult.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Celebs Who Were/Are Fans Of Charles Manson's Music">Celebs Who Were/Are Fans Of Charles Manson's Music</a></span></p><h2 id=christopher-owens><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Christopher Owens</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This musician had an unfortunate upbringing in a cult called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Children of God.</a> While he was able to travel the world with his family, he was exposed to problematic ideals and radical Christianity for the entirety of his childhood. While in this cult, it was like he was completely cut off from the world. His friends would discuss popular movies that he would never be able to see. The <a href=#>isolation and sadness</a> are what led him to cut himself off from the cult and his family. He uses his music to reflect on that time with nostalgia.</p><h2 id=dennis-wilson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Dennis Wilson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/dennis-wilson.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This Beach Boys member was close friends with Charles Manson. Charles Manson had over 100 followers in his cult, the Manson Family, and Wilson was among them. This musician threw parties for the members and was a supporter of Manson. He was introduced to the cult after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he picked up two hitchhikers</a>, and that started his <a href=#>bizarre relationship with Charles Manson</a>. Wilson's free spirit made it to where he could tolerate Manson for a while, but it did not last forever. His fellow band members were also creeped out by Manson, so he ended their friendship and his association with the Family.</p><h2 id=angel-haze><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Angel Haze</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rapper and musician Angel Haze grew up with her mother in the Pentecostal Greater Apostolic Faith Church. She has repeatedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">described it as a cult.</a> When she was outed to her mother, the cult-like brainwashing was evident. She felt like her mother destroyed their relationship<a href=#> over her sexuality</a>, and she blames the church. Also, it was not easy for her to escape the grasp of the church. Her desire to heal herself and tell a story that can resonate with others has helped her through her experiences and come to terms with the memories associated with the cult.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Jessica Simpson TalksÃ‚&nbsp;Being Sexualized While Growing Up In The Church">Jessica Simpson Talks Being Sexualized While Growing Up In The Church</a></span></p><h2 id=toni-braxton><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Toni Braxton</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This musician, who got her start singing in the choir, was also raised in a cult environment. She actually had to pretend to speak in tongues to survive her parents' cult. Like Angel Haze, she was raised in the Pentecostal Greater Apostolic Faith Church where Braxton was expected to be modest and <a href=#>perfect at all costs.</a> Her body itself, no matter how much she tried to cover it up, did not align with the "modesty" that her parents' cult demanded. In her new memoir<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 'Unbreak My Heart</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'</a>, she details how she was told she would "go to hell" for just being who she was. The cult has had lasting effects on her life, and<a href=#> she is still working through them</a> to this day.</p><h2 id=elvis-presley><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Elvis Presley</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/elvis-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The King of Rock</a> did not have as easy of a life as some may expect. He actively sought out a community that could raise his vibration. This led to him joining the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swami Paramahansa Yogananda's Self Realization Fellowship.</a> He actually became close with the leader of this cult as well. While this fellowship, which originated in India, is seen all over the world, some branches in the United States use cult tactics to recruit members. Since <a href=#>Presley sought them out</a>, it is possible he was recruited using those same tactics.</p><h2 id=john-lennon><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>John Lennon</span></h2><p>This former <a href=#>Beatles guitarist</a> has strong connections to the Source, a cult based in an organic restaurant that became influential through its recruitment of celebrities. Between the events in <a href=#>his busy daily schedule, </a>Lennon ate many meals there and interacted with the cult members with familiarity. This strong connection to the restaurant and his interaction with waitresses who were tasked with recruiting new members made him highly susceptible to their tactics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jaden-smith><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jaden Smith</span></h2><p>Recently, <a href=#>indie musician Jaden Smith</a> announced his connection to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Orgonite Society</a>. The goal of this cult is to use and interact with crystals to balance the energy of the Earth. Interestingly, his sister <a href=#>Willow Smith </a>and other celebrities like <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> also show connections. He has even been seen carrying his own crystal pyramid that is supposed to cancel out "bad vibes". However, Smith has a <a href=#>reputation for playing conspiracy pranks</a> on the media, so this could just be a stunt.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="What Religion Is Mary Cosby From 'RHOSLC' And Why Is She Accused Of Running A Cult?">What Religion Is Mary Cosby From 'RHOSLC' And Why Is She Accused Of Running A Cult?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhvZqWlqLaktcCnqmavmKR6qa3VnmSbnZWjeqJ5z5qprWWfm3qiecKuo61n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

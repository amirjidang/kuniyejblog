I watched it grow. And doing the show for almost 20 seasons was one of the highlights of my life," Caitlyn tweeted last year ahead of the Hulu show’s debut. "To be able to work with my family for all those years, connect with the fans, it was incredible. Happy that it continues for my family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Debuting in 2007, KUWTK saw its premiere, and in September 2020, the family made public their decision to conclude the show. Merely three months later, the family entered into a multi-year agreement aimed at "developing worldwide content," set to be exclusively streamed on Hulu within the United States and across various international regions.</p><p>“House of Kardashian” is only the latest television program from the famous family, and given their past success, it’s bound to be a hit amongst fans, too, especially since the family is bringing Caitlyn back.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kim Zolciak & Daughter Brielle Sued Over Massive Unpaid Credit Card Bills</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Digital Spy</a>, <a href=#>Style Caster</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSworXTpbCnZZqau6%2Bx0Wapnq2ensGmv4ywoK2gXaCus7DArJ%2BimZ5is6K5yKWwZp6fp3qvsdZmm6ibpaiys7XErGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

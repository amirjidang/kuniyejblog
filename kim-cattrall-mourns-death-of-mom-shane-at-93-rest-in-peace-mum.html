Shane wore large sunglasses and pearls around her neck.</p><p>The How I Met Your Father actress celebrated Mother’s Day twice this year, also honoring her mom in March for the U.K.’s observance of the holiday.</p><p>“Happy UK Mother’s Day! Our Mum serenading us,” Kim captioned <a href=#>the video</a> of Shane of happily crooning an old British show tune, encouraging her followers to help them out with the song title. “Does anyone recognize the jingle Mum is singing? She couldn’t remember. Your help appreciated. Give your Mum a big hug!” (As fans discovered, the song is George Le Brunn’s “Oh! Mr. Porter” from 1892.)</p><p>Despite Shane’s joy in Kim’s social media posts, she had a “shocking and dramatic” childhood, the Ice Princess star told <a href=#>The Guardian</a> in 2019. “Her father abandoned my grandmother, leaving her in terrible poverty, struggling to bring up three children. As I’ve got older that’s inspired me to want to tell stories about real women who are not Superwoman but need extraordinary powers to survive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kim-Cattrall-Mourns-Death-Mom-Shane-93-0001.jpg><p>Shane’s death comes nearly five years after <a href=#>the passing of Kim’s brother Christopher</a>, who was found dead in 2018 just days after disappearing.</p><p>“It is with great sadness that myself and my family announce the unexpected passing of our son and brother, Chris Cattrall,” the Canada native penned via Instagram at the time, along with a photo with her brother. “At this time we ask for privacy but we want to thank you all on social media for your outpouring of love and support in this trying time.”</p><p>When <a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a> attempted to give her condolences to her former SATC costar, Kim <a href=#>called out</a> the Hocus Pocus actress in a scathing post.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t need your love or support at this tragic time @sarahjessicaparker,” the Meet Monica Velour shared via Instagram at the time. “My Mom asked me today ‘When will that @sarahjessicaparker, that hypocrite, leave you alone?’ Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kim-Cattrall-Mourns-Death-Mom-Shane-93-002.jpg><p>Kim continued: “Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven’t already) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I’m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your ‘nice girl’ persona.”</p><p>Kim’s father, Dennis Cattrall, died in January 2012 at age 86. She flew to his hometown of Liverpool, U.K. to scatter his ashes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1isKLA06uYpaRdory2vs2sZJ2dkam1brvFZqSopV2otaK6xGaYrWVpaHqzsdKtZKKmXaWyoq%2FEZqSupV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

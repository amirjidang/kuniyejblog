A producer from A&E Television, on the other hand, strolled into the store and found it delightful.

Her bids on storage lockers based on a hunch, and her subsequent resourcefulness in putting them to use, won her a lot of followers.</p><p><strong>Mary Padian</strong>‘s experience on the show was bizarre.

Then, while appearing on the show, she continued to run her Texas store.</p><p>She went on to star in the original <strong>Storage Wars</strong>, which was in its fifth season at the time.

She also revealed how she became enamored with antiques and rubbish items.</p><p>During her time with <strong>Storage Wars</strong>, <strong>Mary Padian</strong> decided to expand her company internationally.

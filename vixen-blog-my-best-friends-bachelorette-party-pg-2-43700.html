The bride-to-be Kimberly is an educated, well-rounded, successful&nbsp;career gal with expensive taste. She’s been my partner in crime for a&nbsp;decade, and like me, it takes a lot to impress her. We are not fans of male&nbsp;strippers; the last thing that makes me happy is some greased up bodybuilder&nbsp;picking me up and getting oil all over my Diane Von Furstenburg leggings. As&nbsp;far as travel, we had done Vegas more times than I can recall, and had&nbsp;criss-crossed the States, Mexico, Canada and Caribbean for various events:&nbsp;carnival, award shows, All-Star weekends, boxing matches, white linen yacht&nbsp;parties, work retreats, and all other types of fuckery hot girls in their&nbsp;mid to late 20’s can get into. Reflecting on all of this not only made me&nbsp;more lost as to what could possibly satisfy Kim as her last hurrah as a&nbsp;single woman, it brought tears to my eyes. While our party lives had already&nbsp;calmed significantly over the last couple of years, this event would mark&nbsp;the end of an era.</p><p>I ultimately decided on an island getaway. Puerto Rico was perfect for many&nbsp;reasons. It is a US Commonwealth; which among many things means they use US&nbsp;currency and you do not need a passport to travel there. So our friend that&nbsp;had trouble renewing her passport on short notice was still able to join us.&nbsp;Also, while most of my friends are as well traveled as myself, I recommend&nbsp;San Juan, Puerto Rico to anyone that may be intimidated of international&nbsp;travel. It is a relatively fast-paced vibrant city with lots to do, the&nbsp;flight is only 2 hours from Ft. Lauderdale, and if you don’t speak Spanish&nbsp;many of the locals are friendly and bi-lingual.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6u2ubHNZpmlp5diurp5wZ6qrWWWp7amusOsZJuZk52yrbvRnqutnV2lrrPA2GanoGViYoF0g49pZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

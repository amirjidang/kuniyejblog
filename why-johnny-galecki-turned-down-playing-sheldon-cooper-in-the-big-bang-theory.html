The 49-year-old actor embodied the neurotic socially inept scientist so accurately that most fans would find it difficult to imagine someone else portraying the character. Parson’s stellar portrayal of Sheldon was so critical to The Big Bang Theory’s success that his decision to exit the show ultimately <a href=#>led to the show’s cancellation</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Lesser Known Facts About Johnny Galecki And Jim Parsons' Off-Screen Friendship</a></span></p><p>Interestingly, <a href=#>Jim Parsons was not the preferred candidate</a> for the role at one point. As it turns out, The Big Bang Theory creator, Chuck Lorre, initially offered the iconic role to Johnny Galecki, who turned it down, opting to play Leonard Hofstadter instead. Here’s why Galecki passed on the Sheldon Cooper role despite being a prime candidate.</p><h2 id=johnny-galecki-was-offered-the-chance-to-play-sheldon-cooper>Johnny Galecki Was Offered The Chance To Play Sheldon Cooper</h2><p>Before The Big Bang Theory, Galecki had earned sitcom credits in Roseanne and Blossom. The actor’s performance in these shows caught the eye of The Big Bang Theory showrunner, Chuck Lorre, who initially designed the Sheldon Cooper role with Galecki in mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Johnny was kind of built into this project from the very beginning” Lorre said in a retrospective video released after the show closed its final chapter in 2019. “We started designing around Johnny early on.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jim Parsons Turned Down Johnny Galecki's Audition Request Before Going In Front Of The Cameras</a></span></p><p>However, Galecki decided to pass on the role, opting to play Leonard Hofstadter instead. Fortunately, Galecki was a natural fit for the Leonard role. Even Jim Parsons acknowledged that Galecki’s portrayal of Leonard was unmatched.</p><p>“I know how I felt when I read with him which was very free, there was something so independent about what he was doing,” Parsons said in the retrospective video. “I don’t know, I don’t know how to explain it. I literally felt it from the very first time we read through it together, it was like, ‘well this is different’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-johnny-galecki-turned-down-the-role-of-sheldon-cooper>Why Johnny Galecki Turned Down The Role Of Sheldon Cooper</h2><p>Although Leonard Hofstadter was an integral part of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon Cooper ended up becoming the heart and soul of the show. With this in mind, it’s quite astonishing that Johnny Galecki rejected the iconic role in the first place. As it turns out, the Roseanne actor found the Leonard Hofstadter more interesting because it was so different from what he’d done before.</p><p>“It was a very selfish request on my part,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Galecki told Variety in 2015</a>. “I hadn’t been able to traverse those stories of the heart. I’ve often been cast as the best friend or the gay assistant of whatever character got to explore those relationships. I said I’d rather play this guy, who seems to have a future of romantic triumphs and difficulties.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Big Bang Theory Wanted Johnny Galecki To Play Leonard Without Glasses And They Might've Been Right</a></span></p><p>Galecki was particularly interested in exploring the Leonard-Penny dynamic, which ended up becoming a focal point in the show.</p><p>“I was very attracted to the Leonard role because I saw that Leonard and Penny dynamic being very profound if the show was to go for some time,” he said. “You know, traversing those territories of love, which I hadn't really had a chance to do before. I was cast as the love interest’s best friend or his gay assistant or something like that. I didn’t get a lot of those opportunities.”</p><h2 id=jim-parsons-was-almost-rejected-for-the-role-of-sheldon-cooper>Jim Parsons Was Almost Rejected For The Role Of Sheldon Cooper</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Galecki put himself out of the running, The Big Bang Theory creators, Bill Prady and Chuck Lorre, were left with the arduous task of finding a suitable replacement. Fortunately, the duo didn’t have to wait for long, as Jim Parsons soon came knocking with a mind-blowing audition.</p><p>"When Jim Parsons came in, he was Sheldon on a level,” Bill Prady disclosed on an episode of the At Home with the Creative Coalition podcast. “You know, there were people who came in, and you went, 'Okay, well, he's kind of okay,' 'Oh, he's pretty good,' 'Maybe he's the guy.' And Jim came in, and he was just — from that audition, he was the Sheldon that you saw on television. He created that character at that audition.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Parsons’ stellar audition, Bill Prady was convinced he’d found a worthy replacement. However, Chuck Lorre still had his doubts. “And he left the room and I turned and I went, 'That's the guy! That's the guy! That's the guy!' And Chuck turned, and he said, 'Nah, he's gonna break your heart. He'll never give you that performance again.”</p><p>Fortunately, Prady chose to ignore Lorre’s reservations and invite Parsons for a second audition. “This may be the only example of where I actually was right. And Jim Parsons came back in the next day and gave us that exact same performance again. It was like, 'This is Sheldon.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7ypus2yZKCZnJqwrLWMrayrppWZeqW71qdkqaSRrravs4ysn56klKS7bq%2FOqKeeql2eu27Ax55km6GXYq%2BiusZmq6Gdn6fGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

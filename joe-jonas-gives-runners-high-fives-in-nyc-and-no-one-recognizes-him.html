In the clip, he reached his arm out while offering high fives. Although some runners gave him one back, others ran past Jonas and ignored his<a href=#> attempt at comradery</a>. One thing all the runners had in common is none of them appeared to recognize the singer.</p><p>“Hyping up strangers with high-fives during their 6pm run 🙏🏃,” he captioned the post as <strong>Natasha Bedingfield</strong>’s “Pocketful of Sunshine” played in the background. “Don’t leave me hanging 🥲😂.” Fans laughed with Jonas in his comments section.</p><p>“I literally ran right past him in Brooklyn and was wondering why I was being recorded & he was trying to high five me! Didn’t realize who he was!!” one follower who ran by Jonas commented. “Imagine dodging a stranger’s high five only to get home, scroll tiktok, and find out it was Joe 💀,” another wrote, as a third social media user quipped, “When they realize the weird guy high giving everyone is JOE JONAS.”</p><p>Jonas was back in NYC before he takes off on is the 2024 leg of <a href=#>The Tour </a>with brothers <strong>Nick Jonas</strong> and <strong>Kevin Jonas</strong>. Starting in Manila, Philippines, the Jonas Brothers are traveling through countries including France, Australia, England, Mexico, Argentina and more.</p><a title=@joejonas href=#>@joejonas</a><p>Don’t leave me hanging 🥲😂</p><p><a title="♬ Pocketful of Sunshine - Natasha Bedingfield" href=#>♬ Pocketful of Sunshine – Natasha Bedingfield</a></p><p>During their shows, the Jonas Brothers sing 67 hits from albums including The Album, which dropped in 2023, Happiness Begins (2019), Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), A Little Bit Longer (2008), and Jonas Brothers (2007).</p><p>In December 2023, the band announced they’ll be hosting a <a href=#>20th anniversary concert</a> in 2025, after The Tour concludes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[From] two nights at Yankee Stadium, we have since played 61-or-something shows. We’ve reached the end, but we left you all a card on your seats, I don’t know if you got those when you got in,” Nick, 31, told the crowd while playing at New York’s Barclays Center in Brooklyn.</p><p>Joe then replied, asking what the note said while Nick explained, “OK, so in 2025, it’ll be the 20-year anniversary of this ban. And that card was your formal invite [because] we’re gonna do this thing again.”</p><p>The Jonas Brothers recorded their first song, “Please Be Mine,” in 2005. They later starred in Disney’s 2008 Camp Rock, before creating their own series, Jonas, from 2009 until 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5Vit7C6wKxkoKGmmsBuvtSnpZ6qo2K1qrPHZp2irpWoeqq6jKewnGWRo7Fuus5mpqedXaeypLvGp6CznaNitaq5jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

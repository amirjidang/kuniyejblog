Because labels stopped supporting the perception of Black men being more than displaying a ‘thug image.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He added, “Let me disclaim, my tweets are not to say there aren’t any great singers out there. There always have been great singers, but the love they get is disproportionate. So let’s do this: send me some artists y’all think are and I’ll repost! I’ll go first.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He concluded his sentiments and expressed gratitude to those who didn’t take what he said the wrong way. He tweeted, “Thanks to those who understand my comments concerning R&B is out of pure concern for the culture I gave my life to. It’s not about dissing anyone, it’s not about excluding those who rep the right way. Just bringing 2 light that the love 4 the real is disproportionate.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The singer’s tweets seem to have been prompted by the <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234671079>recent <a href=# id=auto-tag_verzuz data-tag=verzuz>Verzuz</a> battle</a> between R&B singers Omarion and Mario, with other performances by Ray J, Sammie, Bobby V, and Pleasure P. Following the battle, there were plenty of mixed views about the vocal capabilities of Omarion, Ray J, and Jeremiah specifically. In addition, R&B sensation <a href=#>Giveon</a> also caught flack for his <a href=#>recent BET Awards performance</a> in which he blamed what appeared to be his vocal shortcomings on the technical difficulties of his microphone.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Are you in agreement with Shawn?

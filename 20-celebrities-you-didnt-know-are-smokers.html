Through the years, as more people learned what harm smoking could actually cause to one’s health, that changed. Now it’s viewed as a somewhat ‘dirty’ habit and with more and more public areas, restaurants, malls, airports, and other facilities that don’t permit smoking in their establishment (either by choice or due to the law), it’s increasingly troubling for some fans to see their favorite celebrities as smokers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In reality, we’re not likely to just see many celebrities hanging out on the street corner or outside the mall lighting up, but that doesn’t mean they don’t do it. There are plenty of celebrities who smoke and who have developed a good and effective way of hiding it from the public.</p><p>Does this change our perception of these celebrities? It might. For some, smoking is a bad habit that not only harm’s the health of the person who does it, but anyone else who is around him or her. Here are 20 such celebrities (including many big name stars) who are smokers and who wouldn’t seem to be taking on this type of habit based on their usual public appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-keira-knightley><strong>20. Keira Knightley</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Keira Knightly</a> broke onto the U.S. Hollywood scene in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and while she has maintained a relatively clean cut image on and off the screen (avoiding risqué roles, for the most part), she isn’t quite the innocent young woman many fans fell in love with during that initial franchise. Sure, she can seem tough on film and while she may very well be tough in person, too, she’s also a smoker. She has been caught lighting up while walking down the street on more than a few occasions. She also plays the guitar, so maybe it’s a music thing.</p><p></p><h2 id=19-kate-hudson><strong>19. Kate Hudson</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kate Hudson</a> may come from strong Hollywood pedigree, but one thing many people comment on whenever they work with her or spend any length of time with her is just how pleasant she is to be around. She can light up a room and the young actress who has starred in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Almost Famous, and Bride Wars is also a smoker. She’s been caught on camera smoking at a beach, on the street, and even on a back studio lot just relaxing between takes. When one compares her on screen characters to real life, they might be surprised.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=18-cameron-diaz><strong>18. Cameron Diaz</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> has been in the Hollywood news for many years. She truly made a name for herself in the comedy There’s Something About Mary, but she has also played tough female characters in films like Charlie’s Angels and Gangs of New York. When she was the voice of Princess Fiona in Shrek, she became an instant classic hit among young fans. However, it might upset some of them (who would now be full grown adults themselves) to learn that Cameron Diaz is also a smoker. It’s not easy to see someone who appears clean cut on film lighting up.</p><p></p><h2 id=17-elijah-wood><strong>17. Elijah Wood</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Elijah Wood</a> often took on roles of young, innocent looking boys and men, but his biggest role (probably for the rest of his life now) will be as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings. He was convincing as the hapless yet determine Hobbit trying to destroy evil and do what no man or other creature could do … save the world. Many people instantly associated his life with that lovable Hobbit and right or wrong, there are certain characteristics to Hobbits that people want to believe in, such as full of life and love for nature. Smoking kind of goes against that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=16-mila-kunis><strong>16. Mila Kunis</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> has long held a certain reputation&nbsp;on and off the screen as being a kind, sweet young woman with a clean cut image. Her roles in Black Swan and Ted certainly shook things up a bit, as well as her film with <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> Friends with Benefits, but even with her more adult sexuality coming through on the big screen, it’s hard to see this young, beautiful woman as being a smoker, at least for us. In most of her films she simply comes across as too innocent to even consider taking on such a habit, but alas, that’s exactly what happened.</p><p></p><h2 id=15-katherine-heigl><strong>15. Katherine Heigl</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Katherine Heigl</a> has appeared on more than one list of things many people didn’t know about their favorite celebrities and while she may not be the most personable actress in the world (there are notorious stories about how she is ruining –or has ruined- her career because of her over the top attitude), she is also a smoker. The Knocked Up actress may not be as highly sought after as an actress right now, but that doesn’t mean her career is completely over … yet. Maybe if she keeps on smoking she’ll develop a different image that some directors want to work with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=14-miley-cyrus><strong>14. Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p>The daughter of <a href=#>Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, the man who brought the world the hit country song "Achy Breaky Heart" was a darling of Disney as Hannah Montana. When she turned 18, though, everything seemed to completely change. It was as though she stripped off her nice girl image, trampled on it a few times, then threw it into a raging fire. <a href=#>Miley</a>&nbsp;has gone on to be scandalized with a sex tape, provocative performances, and some less than stellar reviews for her shows, which include automatic pitch correction claims. She also smokes and is reported to do other bad habits as well.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-britney-spears><strong>13. Britney Spears</strong></h2><p>While <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> may not be in the limelight anymore, few people could claim that it had anything to do with her music and performances. She was another Disney star who once had a stellar reputation to being sweet, innocent, and clean cut. She long trashed that image and has been caught sans underwear in public and in a number of other high profile incidents that didn’t do anything to help her appeal to those who loved her music. One thing that seems to shock people still, though, about her is the fact that she is a regular smoker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-jennifer-lopez><strong>12. Jennifer Lopez</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> has been hailed and berated for her music and acting. Some people believe she is a great artist while others wonder how she even built a career in entertainment. However people view her, one thing is certain: she is a smoker. She does manage to hide this habit fairly well for the most part, though, as this seems to be quite the surprise for a lot of people. She may be a diva whose demands for performances, interviews, and other appearances are legendary, but she continues to be an icon in the entertainment industry.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-kristen-stewart><strong>11. Kristen Stewart</strong></h2><p>With an almost flat affect during the Twilight movies for which she became a household name, even&nbsp;films <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> has done since those were completed haven’t done much to help change her Hollywood image of a wooden actress without any real emotional depth. However, as her character in the Twilight films was a high school girl who had her challenges in life, that character wasn’t a smoker. Yet in real life Kristen Stewart is and that doesn’t do much to help her likability among some fans of the Twilight films, or other works she has taken on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-ryan-gosling><strong>10. Ryan Gosling</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> is one of those actors who has built a solid following among both men and women. Men like him because he has a macho flair and women like him because he has chiseled, handsome looks. During his films, the focus is on him getting into character and there is little thought to whether or not he might be a smoker in real life. Well, in truth, even though it might have been a surprise to us, he is a smoker. He has been captured on camera taking a break and walking down the street with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-mary-kate-olsen><strong>9. Mary Kate Olsen</strong></h2><p>One half of the Olsen twins, <a href=#>Mary Kate</a> (and her sister Ashley) was essentially born into the spotlight. As the lovable baby on the television show Full House, these twins were needed to play one character because of their infancy. They grew up under the intense glare of public adoration and speculation and while Mary Kate doesn’t act and focuses more on her fashion line, the often too-thin young woman is also a smoker. We’re not sure when she might have started with the habit, but when a person grows up in Hollywood, there are far too many opportunities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-kate-moss><strong>8. Kate Moss</strong></h2><p>Supermodel <a href=#>Kate Moss</a> gained a great deal of attention earlier in her career not just for her incredible beauty, but because she was also considered incredibly thin. While she may not be as thin now as she was then, she has also been willing to appear nude at just about any time. She hasn’t provided the public with any misconceptions about who she is, but when we think about somebody who is a beautiful model, we might not directly associate that with also being a smoker. However, maybe it’s the industry because there seems to be a lot of models who smoke.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-kelly-osbourne><strong>7. Kelly Osbourne</strong></h2><p>Being famous because of your father must not be an easy thing to deal with. After all, <a href=#>Ozzy Osbourne</a> is one of the most recognizable figures in rock and roll history and continues to draw crowds with his performances. <a href=#>Kelly</a> made a name for herself during their family’s reality show and while she might have come across as a young woman who was outside of the usual trials and tribulations that come with being a rock family, she does seem to have taken on some of her father’s habits, including smoking. We don’t blame her, though; it can’t be easy growing up in that lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-kirsten-dunst><strong>6. Kirsten Dunst</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kirsten Dunst</a> may be most recognizable as playing the role of Mary in the Spider-Man trilogy, but she started acting at a young age. Many people can remember her in the movie Jumangi with <a href=#>Robin Williams</a>. She has also played characters that were seemingly innocent and sweet, smart, funny, and affable. It wouldn’t seem reasonable to think about her as a smoker, but that’s exactly what she is. She has been caught several times smoking while out and about and that means she probably doesn’t care what we think about it.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-katy-perry><strong>5. Katy Perry</strong></h2><p>Singers are the one profession that people might not associate with being smokers. Of course, there are plenty of rock musicians through the years who have been heavy smokers, but they’ve also been highly addicted to alcohol and drugs, too, and smoking as a musician seems to go hand in hand with that. <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> has had a strong innocent image in the public eye, in spite of some of her songs that had a highly sexualized charge to them. She is a smoker, too, and that could have impacted her clean cut image if it was more widely known.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-adele><strong>4. Adele</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Adele</a> is a crossover singer whose unique jazz style captured the hearts of millions of fans around the world with her popular songs. She has since stepped away from performances after having a child, but it’s highly anticipated that she will be returning to the music scene in time. She also had trouble with her voice as it was under a lot of strain. Because of how much she relies on her unique voice for her performances, it’s a serious surprise that she’s a smoker, given just how much harm this habit can do to the vocal cords.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-eva-longoria><strong>3. Eva Longoria</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Eva Longoria</a> is most widely known for her role in the television series Desperate Housewives, but she was also the character in that show that seemed to be the most innocent. Her physical appearance also belies a certain type of innocence, so it was quite a surprise for us to learn that she is indeed a smoker. We’re not sure just how much she smokes, but she’s been spotted on more than just a few occasions lighting up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-jessica-alba><strong>2. Jessica Alba</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jessica Alba</a> seems to have separated herself from Hollywood in order to raise her children, and that’s a commendable thing. Growing up under the glare of the Hollywood lights, even if it’s because of a parent, cannot be an easy thing to do. However, during her career she took on a wide range of roles and many of them were of strong, independent women. We didn’t see her smoking on film, and we developed a certain expectation about what she might be off camera as a result. It turns out she smokes, too.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-simon-cowell><strong>1. Simon Cowell</strong></h2><p>American Idol founder <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> has made hundreds of millions of dollars in the entertainment industry and while he may come across as abrasive, mocking, brash, and condescending, he’s also got an incredible ear for talent. Susan Boyle may be the most glaring example of that as he laughed and mocked her homely, older woman appearance as she stepped on stage, and her choice of song, but she blew the world away with her voice and he made her a star. In the music business, it seems many people smoke and Simon Cowell is one of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>shefinds.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmtoXZiyrbHBq6CtoZWoerq71GabopyeqXqsus6wZJqqlWLArrvKnqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

While pals like <a href=#><strong>Malika Haqq</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Winnie Harlow</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jason Kennedy</strong></a> praised Kardashian’s fit figure, one fan thought the Poosh founder’s platform could serve a different purpose.</p><p>“Why can’t you donate more money or your time to help people of the world?” the Instagram user commented.</p><p>Despite the criticism, Kardashian replied with a positive outlook. “Always wanting to help more, do you have suggestions?” she wrote back with a heart and a prayer hands emoji. “Let’s encourage each other … As humans sharing this planet, I find it our duty to help each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kourtney-Kardashian-Asks-for-Suggestions-After-Fan-Says-to-Donate-More.jpg><p>In April, another follower <a href=#>called the Kardashian family into question</a> as several other major Hollywood stars made substantial contributions to <a href=#>help first responders and other essential workers</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, the Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami alum defended herself and her siblings with a Bible verse.</p><p>“Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward (Matthew 6:2 ESV),” she replied.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kourtney-Kardashian-Asks-for-Suggestions-After-Fan-Says-to-Donate-More-2.jpg><p>While some may not think the Kardashian-Jenner clan are doing enough to make a positive impact, the media moguls have displayed a number of acts of kindness during these difficult times. Earlier this year, <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> donated $1 million</a> to help buy personal protective equipment for healthcare workers to fight the spread of COVID-19 and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> was spotted <a href=#>paying for elderly shoppers’ groceries</a> at a Trader Joe’s in Los Angeles. <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, for her part, has been vocal about fighting racial injustice and donated $1 million toward coronavirus relief efforts through her SKIMS shapewear brand in March.</p><p>“I am so grateful to all of you who have supported SKIMS since we first started six months ago,” Kim, 39, wrote in a statement at the time. “It’s been a dream of mine for so long, and has only been possible because of your love for what we do. Our six-month anniversary has fallen in the middle of a global crisis so more than ever, <a href=#>it’s our responsibility to give back</a> and do what we can to help others.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp6Wnwa%2Bx2GaimqqUlsCptcCnZKudkZjBtHnAn6ueql2brq95wKyirGWYmr9uwM5mm6imkamybrnOq5xo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

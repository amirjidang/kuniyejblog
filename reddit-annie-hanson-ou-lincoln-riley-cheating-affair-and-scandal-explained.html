There was a text message on Reddit before the user deleted it.&nbsp;</p><p>A source seems to have gotten access to the text. Now, netizens are looking at it to figure out what it is all about. The text suggests that OU is firing Annie following the cheating scandal.&nbsp;</p><p>But, reports suggest that she and her husband will be joining USC. The team has recruited her husband, a football coach.

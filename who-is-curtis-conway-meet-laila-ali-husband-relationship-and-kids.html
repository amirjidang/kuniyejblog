Meet Laila Ali Husband: Relationship And Kids</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Both <strong>Laila Ali and her husband Curtis Conway</strong> had previously failed marriages. They ended their relationships with their ex-partners since things did not go as planned. Laila and Curtis, on the other hand, found happiness in their relationship and married in 2007. They are currently the parents of two children. Laila Amaria Ali is a former professional boxer and television personality from the United States. From 1999 until 2007, she had a remarkable boxing career in which she was unbeaten.</p><p>Laila Ali, the daughter of great boxer Muhammad Ali, has always aspired to be a fighter since she was a toddler.&nbsp;Her father, on the other hand, was opposed to the plan since it may gravely damage Laila. His Muslim beliefs and relatively archaic ideas on gender roles kept him from supporting her boxing career.&nbsp;In an interview, she said that he believed that women should not participate in boxing. Despite her father’s reservations, she began boxing at the age of 18.</p><p>Laila held many championships during her career, including the WBC, WIBA, IWBF, and IBA female super middleweight belts, as well as the IWBF light heavyweight title.&nbsp;She is widely regarded as one of the finest female professional fighters of all time in the boxing world.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=laila-ali-husband></span>Laila Ali Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Laila Ali</strong> has had two marriages in her life. She previously married <strong>Johnny McClain</strong>, a well-known celebrity and boxer, in 2000. After just five years of marriage, they decided to divorce and go their ways. Laila is now married to Curtis Conway, a former National Football League (NFL) wide receiver. Conway attended Hawthorne High School in Hawthorne, California, where he excelled in football and track. He rose to prominence as a senior quarterback, winning All-America accolades. Coach Dave Keller led him through his high school football career, while famous coach Kye Courtney refined his track abilities.&nbsp;Later, he started his professional career after being taken in the first round of the 1993 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=curtis-conway-worked-as-a-studio-analyst></span>Curtis Conway Worked As A Studio Analyst<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Conway began working in sports broadcasting in 2009, after retiring from football. He served as a color commentator for Compass Media Networks’ national NFL radio broadcasts. Conway is now expanding his radio career. He is currently a studio analyst for the Pac-12 Network, where he provides views and opinions on a variety of college sports subjects.&nbsp;He also co-hosts “Total Access” on the NFL Network, where he contributes to conversations and coverage of NFL news and events.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=curtis-conway-and-laila-ali-share-two-children></span>Curtis Conway and Laila Ali Share Two Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Laila Ali</strong> and former NFL player <strong>Curtis Conway</strong> exchanged vows in Los Angeles on July 23, 2007.&nbsp;Laila revealed her pregnancy around a year later, and their son Curtis Muhammad Conway Jr. was born in August 2008.

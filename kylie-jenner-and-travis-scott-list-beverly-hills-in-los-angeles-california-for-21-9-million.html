Days after the rapper took to Instagram to deny accusations that he cheated on the reality star, the pair have placed their jointly-owned Beverly Hills mansion on the market for $21.9 million.</p><p>One thing all the Kardashians share is a passion for collecting trophy real estate. By our count, Kris Jenner and her five daughters now own more than 20 multimillion-dollar properties spread across Southern California. That includes a luxury condo Jenner used exclusively for gift-wrapping presents and storing champagne — a condo she accidentally abandoned after forgetting she still owns it. Whoops!</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Lil Baby Gets Some Wildly Lavish Gifts For His Birthday</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But even billionaires like to trim their holdings now and again, and so Kylie Jenner is putting one of her “spare” homes up for grabs. Resembling a contemporary European villa, the strikingly angular home lies in the mountains immediately above Beverly Hills, in the lower Benedict Canyon neighborhood. Asking $21.9 million, the nearly 10,000-square-foot mansion includes seven bedrooms, eight full bathrooms and two powder rooms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5.jpg><p>Should the property sell for anywhere near that amount, it will rank as an impressive profit for Jenner and Travis Scott, who jointly paid $13.5 million for the house back in 2018. Records show the much-published pair holds a 50/50 stake in the 1.1-acre estate, which lies at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, guarded by a towering gate and elaborate security system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Behind those fortifications, the soothing estate features neutral, earth-toned colors and bespoke finishes throughout. Main floor highlights include walls with designer treatments, oak floors, imported stone and a vast array of floor-to-ceiling glass doors opening to lush gardens that surround the house. The kitchen, awash in white marble countertops and lustrous ebony cabinetry, connects to a breakfast room and walk-in pantry, and there’s also a formal dining room that spills out to an al fresco dining terrace.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/6.5.jpg><p>Upstairs, the master bedroom flaunts a sitting area and private balcony, plus head-on city and canyon views. There are dual master baths, at least one with a soaking tub and flatscreen TV, dual walk-in closets, a fireplace and a vanity/glam room where Jenner would get “glammed” by her team of professional makeup artists. There are six additional bedrooms, all of them with ensuite baths — one of them once used as a nursery for Jenner and Scott’s daughter Stormi Webster, per <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A sampling of the home’s numerous other amenities include a blacked-out movie theater, a blacked-out billiard room with a marble wet bar, a lounge, family room, garaging for three cars and a fireplace-equipped living room overlooking the pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4.jpg><p>The home they are looking to part ways with is contemporary and trendy, with oak floors throughout and sliding glass doors for easy indoor-outdoor living. Moody black cabinetry adds drama to the kitchen, and a black accent wall surrounding the fireplace in the living room makes for a cozy elegance. Amenities on the 1.1 acre property include a swimming pool, spa, 3-car garage, built-in BBQ, and even a detached guest house, according to<a href=#><i> Architectural Digest.</i></a></p><p>Tomer Fridman of Compass holds the listing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenner still owns a multitude of other properties: a $36 million Holmby Hills mansion, a $15 million vacant lot, and she’s currently building a very custom desert vacation mansion in La Quinta’s Madison Club. But since 2016, the Kylie Cosmetics founder’s main residence has been a lavish Hidden Hills estate that was photographed for Architectural Digest some years ago. As for Scott, he presides over a $23 million hilltop mansion in Brentwood.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Rihanna’s Comebacks With ‘Lift Me Up’ Music Track From Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Film</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a>, <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaksZyesm62xKelnqpdlruledOrmK%2Bho2LApLvTrWSloaOpeqOx1Z6ppbFdnbatuNJmoKdlnKTAbq3NoJylnaNisKK4yJ%2Bmq6aZlnqnu9FmaWplaWK6qrjLoqanZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

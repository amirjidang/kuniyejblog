Charli, however, remains unsure about her plans since she will likely have to film with Raquel, 28, in the aftermath of the beauty queen’s affair with <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Charli-Burnett-Reveals-the-Reason-Why-She-Might-Not-Return-for-Season-11-of-Vanderpump-Rules-Has-to-Do-With-Raquel-Leviss.jpg><p>“That’s uncomfortable for me because I love <a href=#><strong>Ariana [Madix]</strong></a>. I am Ariana’s friend and I’m very upset with everything that’s going on,” Charli explained, referring to Sandoval’s ex-girlfriend. “So I feel like filming next season would be very, very weird and really stressful.”</p><p>During season 10, the esthetician was on Raquel’s side amid her feud with <a href=#><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a>. The California native <a href=#>found herself at odds with her costars</a> after she showed interest in Katie’s ex-husband, <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a>. (The former couple <a href=#>were married for six years before calling it quits</a> in March 2022.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Charli-Burnett-Reveals-the-Reason-Why-She-Might-Not-Return-for-Season-11-of-Vanderpump-Rules-Has-to-Do-With-Raquel-Leviss-2.jpg><p>Things took a turn off screen, however, when Us Weekly confirmed in March that Sandoval, 40, and Ariana, 37, <a href=#>had ended their nine-year relationship</a> due to his affair with Raquel. Charli, for her part, said <a href=#>she regretted defending Raquel so often throughout season 10.</a></p><p>“Oh wow would these convos go differently now,” she tweeted that same month <a href=#>while watching an episode of the Bravo series</a>. “I hate when people aren’t honest. Tbh 🙃 I feel incredibly silly on some things obvi knowing what I know now. I can take the accountability on my end always.”</p><p>Charli continued: “But what I won’t apologize for is always being a good & honest girls girl. Even if I look dumb for believing someone. I pride myself always on being a good friend. Especially to the women around me. I am only responsible for my words & actions if they ever hurt anyone.. xx 🤍.”</p><p>Following the season finale, which aired in May, Charli has been considering all her options. The social media influencer admitted she was also <a href=#>concerned about filming with past cast members</a> amid speculation of surprising returns.</p><p>“Old cast members are rumored to come back. I don’t know how that will look, but I imagine they’re probably going to come back with a force because they want to keep that spot again. They don’t want to lose that paycheck,” she told the magazine on Wednesday. “If they did bring <a href=#><strong>Jax [Taylor]</strong></a> back, Tom Sandoval is probably going to be so f—king pissed.”</p><p>Charli noted that she is interested to see <a href=#>how the aftermath of the cheating scandal will continue</a> to play out, saying, “A lot of them thrive in that chaotic environment. I also think that with this group, a lot of people flip-flop. I’m actually curious to see if everyone still stays friends like they are right now. Everyone has a really core strength because we all hate Tom [Sandoval] and Raquel, but we also know how that goes. I’m very curious to see how it unfolds and I think it probably will unfold very messily.”</p><p>According to Charli, her experience filming season 10 <a href=#>made her reconsider the way she approaches her friendships</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It definitely has made everything feel very jaded and has brought up a lot of my old trust issues with people. It makes me question who I was with last summer,” she explained about her past bond with Raquel. “Watching those scenes back, anyone can be like, ‘I wish I saw or I wish I knew.’ I said to myself, ‘How could you not put two and two together?’ I was so blind to things, but I think at the time we’re exhausted from filming and there’s so much going on.”</p><p>She concluded: “There are so many moving parts and I think a lot of the time you don’t really see things in a clear vision because of that. But now it kind of feels like we were all pawns in Tom and Raquel’s little game. Honestly, watching back I’m like, ‘Is Tom a f—king cult leader? What is he saying to people and convincing them of?’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhmaKhtm6u1KulnqykYsSpxYyiZKahl53BbrrOrWSrnaSqv695xaipZqilor1uvtSlnKxlo5qutLvNZmhqZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

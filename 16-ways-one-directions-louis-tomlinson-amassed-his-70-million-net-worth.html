The band released five albums during their time together.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>All of </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>their records went platinum</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and generated a ton of revenue.

He gets a large chunk of his net worth from those sales.</p><h2 id=touring-with-1d><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Touring With 1D</span></span></h2><p>While One Direction albums alone generated a lot of profit, the tours amassed a lot of money for all of the members.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Their </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Where We Are</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> tour </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>grossed over $290 million</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and was the highest earning tour for that year.

It’s called </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>Triple Strings Ltd</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p>It was something he had wanted to do for a long time. The company was created under Simon Cowell’s Syco Entertainment and he worked with One Direction’s legal adviser, Lawrence Engel.</p><h2 id=playing-football><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Playing Football</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>While everyone knows Tomlinson is a successful and talented musical artist, he is also a pretty decent athlete. He’s played soccer for years.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2013, he was </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>signed to the Doncaster Rovers</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. Not only that, but he actually </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>owns the team</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, following the example of singer Elton John, who previously owned a soccer club.</span></p><h2 id=his-collab-with-steve-aoki><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>His Collab With Steve Aoki</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in 2016, Tomlinson </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>recorded a song</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> with DJ Steve Aoki. The catchy EDM hit is called “Just Hold On”.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It debuted at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 and is still being played on the radio today.

There were t-shirts, buttons, and posters in every store.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Tomlinson received a large chunk of his net worth from the sale of this merchandise. In 2013, the band </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>made $57.5 million </span></a><span style=font-weight:400>just from merch sales.</span></p><h2 id=his-single-just-like-you><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>His Single “Just Like You”</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Just Like You” was a single recorded by Tomlinson in 2017. It was the first single he released to promote his solo career.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The release of the song </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>was a surprise </span></a><span style=font-weight:400>to his fans. It didn't end up being included on his debut album </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Walls</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, but it’s one of his personal favorite songs.</span></p><h2 id=his-songwriting-credits-with-1d><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>His Songwriting Credits With 1D</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Not many people are aware, but Tomlinson has the most writing credits out of all the members of One Direction. He </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>co-wrote 37 </span></a><span style=font-weight:400>of their tracks.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He earns more royalties from those songs than the other boys because of it. Liam also helped write a lot of their songs and earns extra money from them as well.</p><h2 id=participating-in-the-1d-documentary><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Participating In The 1D Documentary</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>On top of world tours and album sales, the One Direction boys filmed a documentary about the band.

The other boys received large payments as well.</span></p><p>The band was one of Cowell’s most successful acts. They had many years of success together before splitting ways to work on their solo careers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times Simon Cowell Was Savage AF</a></span></p><h2 id=his-single-miss-you><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>His Single “Miss You”</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Tomlinson released another single that didn’t make it onto his debut album everywhere, though it is a bonus track in certain countries. The song was called “</span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>Miss You</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>”.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>It was more pop-punk than some of his other songs, surprising fans. He performed it live on the reality show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The X Factor.</span></i></p><h2 id=his-collab-with-bebe-rexha><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>His Collab With Bebe Rexha</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of Tomlinson’s most successful solo songs is his collaboration with singer Bebe Rexha. They have a duet called “</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Back To You</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>” that added to Tomlinson’s net worth.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It charted in nine countries and it was the </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>number one trending song </span></a><span style=font-weight:400>in the UK. He was the last of all the One Direction members to have a song outside of the band chart at number one.</span></p><h2 id=guest-judging-on-america-s-got-talent><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Guest Judging On America’s Got Talent</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Apparently, Tomlinson likes to judge talent competitions. He was a judge on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>X Factor</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and a </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>judge on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>America’s Got Talent</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400> at one point.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>America’s Got Talent, </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>they had a panel of guest judges, including Tomlinson, Simon Cowell, Mel B, Heidi Klum, and Howie Mandel.

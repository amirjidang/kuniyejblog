It’s a reality show where they live next door to each other, party together, and support one another. Many of them are there to search for something outside their hometowns and find their own way. They came to pursue their dream jobs and make connections in a new, booming city.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Twentysomethings: Austin' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>One of the show's closest relationships that fans loved was the friendship between Keauno, known as Keke on the show, and Bruce. They bonded despite their differences, and Bruce showed Keauno he had a true friend in the house when he needed one. Fans loved to see the connection between these two guys, coming from different states and having different lifestyles. Throughout the season, Keauno and Bruce had each other's backs. They had someone in the house to connect with and lean on when they needed a friend.</p><p><span class=article-alert>Spoiler Alert: The rest of this article contains spoilers from 'Twentysomethings: Austin' season one.</span></p><h2 id=a-tight-bond-between-keauno-and-bruce><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>A Tight Bond Between Keauno And Bruce</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They were the first two to arrive at the boys house and bonded quickly over a drink. Bruce came from South Carolina and Keauno is from Arkansas. Keauno is an open book, sharing with Bruce his dilemma about whether to come to Austin or keeping his job. Bruce is very understanding, and together they admit they’re there for the same reasons. As Keauno said, "I just really wanna focus on myself." Bruce cheers Keauno up, saying, "That’s why we're both here." They bond over figuring it out and being on a new journey together in an unfamiliar city. Bruce said, "It’s gonna be a good couple of months, man."</p><h2 id=no-judgment><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>No Judgment</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the first day, when everyone was getting to know each other, Keauno was very open and said, "my life I’ve been living, not my authentic self." Abbey, Natalie, and Bruce were very understanding towards Keauno’s feelings when he says, "I don’t even know how to be gay." There’s no judgment coming from Bruce as Keauno openly talks about his sexual orientation and Bruce even agreed to go to a gay bar with the group to support Keke.</p><h2 id=encouragement-from-bruce><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Encouragement From Bruce</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keke is very confused and overwhelmed as he finally comes out as gay and starts darting men. Keauno feels comfortable enough to ask Bruce for advice about Oscar, a guy Keke met at the bar. He tells Bruce that Oscar has been texting him, and he doesn’t know what to text back. Bruce is very encouraging, saying, "Let’s get this straight, so you’ve got Oscar that you met at Rain. That’s exciting." Bruce gives Keke great and genuine advice, telling him to "test the waters," and sits next to him as Keke video calls Oscar to ask him on a date.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'The Real World: Austin': Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><h2 id=natural-chemistry-between-keauno-and-bruce><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Natural Chemistry Between Keauno And Bruce</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their friendship is natural and fun as they celebrate their wins and support each other through their losses. Bruce was happy for Keke after Oscar agreed to go on a date with him. They bonded quickly and shared personal moments early in the season. When Keke learned his grandmother had passed away, he was in tears, remembering her saying, "live your best life and follow your heart." Bruce comes in, and before even asking why he’s crying, he hugs Keke. Bruce is very heartfelt at the moment, giving him hugs and saying, "it’s okay to cry." Keke later said, "I was so thankful for the words Bruce told me and the love he gave me."</p><h2 id=bruce-and-keauno-don-39-t-stereotype-each-other><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bruce And Keauno Don't Stereotype Each Other</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Relationships are a big aspect of the show</a>. Bruce and Isha started flirting on the first night, but Isha had stereotyped him early on for being a country boy from the south. He was upfront with her, saying he didn’t want her to stereotype him, and he would do the same in return. Bruce and Isha's connection didn’t last, but Keke didn’t stereotype Bruce or think down on his southern roots, even though Keke is from a very conservative state himself. He might have come into the house with a negative outlook on people with similar political or cultural ideas.</p><h2 id=keauno-and-bruce-are-both-open-minded><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Keauno And Bruce Are Both Open-Minded</span></h2><p>Many people from the countryside are stereotyped as overly closed-minded. However, Bruce shows he’s much more than his hometown roots and accepts everyone for their authentic self. He’s a handsome baseball player with a ton of love in his heart and seems like the type of person who’s open-minded and just wants to have fun. He shows his willingness to open up and get to know Keke even though they wouldn’t normally look like the types to be pals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Abbey Humphreys Before Joining 'Twentysomethings: Austin'</a></span></p><h2 id=keauno-and-bruce-39-s-personalities-matched><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Keauno And Bruce's Personalities Matched</span></h2><p>They’re both <a href=#>happy, go-lucky people</a>, which is a big reason they bonded and got along so well. It was hard for Bruce and the other cast members when Keke chose to take time away from the house to spend with his family. Everyone was happy to see Keke come back, and Bruce joined him, Natalie, and Raquel outside to hear about his trip. Together, they understand each other as they’re both very close to their families. Bruce says, "We love you, Keke." Later in the season, Keke said, Bruce taught him that "friendships can have no barriers."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-supportive-friendship-between-keauno-and-bruce><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Supportive Friendship Between Keauno And Bruce</span></h2><p>Bruce came to Keke when he needed a shoulder to lean on. After Keke went home to spend time with his family, Bruce had a lot of thinking to do about his family situation. Bruce went to a job interview, and after it went well, he was less excited and more worried about moving away from his home. He told Keke, "I miss my family. I've just been dwelling on it the past couple of days. Family is everything." This is the first sign of Bruce leaving the house early to go home. While making his decision to settle in Austin or go home, he went to discuss it with Keke and said, "I wanted to let you know what I was thinking." Keke is sad to hear Bruce has decided to leave the house and go home, but was supportive and understanding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything We Know About The Reboot Of ‘The Real World’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ylpq%2BdXZe%2Ftq%2FEZpinnF2gsqLBzahkn6qZmrulv8eip2asp5q7tcWMrKamnaSdtq%2Bz0maYrquknrtw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
